The new default is FALSE\n      which makes child processes non-interactive by default (this\n      prevents lock-ups due to children waiting for interactive input).\n\n    o scan() now warns when end-of-file occurs within a quoted string.\n\n    o count.fields() is now consistent with scan() in its handling of\n      newlines in quoted strings.  Instead of triggering an error, this\n      results in the current line receiving NA as the field count, with\n      the next line getting the total count of the two lines.\n\n    o The default method of image() will plot axes of the class of xlim\n      and ylim (and hence of x and y if there is a suitable range()\n      method).  Based on a suggestion of Michael Sumner.\n\n    o load() now has a verbose argument for debugging support, to print\n      the names of objects just before loading them.\n\n    o When loading a serialized object encounters a reference to a\n      namespace which cannot be loaded, this is replaced by a reference\n      to the global environment, with a warning.\n\n    o pairs() gains a line.main option for title placement.\n\n    o The remaining instances in which serialization to a raw vector\n      was limited to 2GB have been unlimited on a 64-bit platform, and\n      in most cases serialization to a vector of more than 1GB will be\n      substantially faster.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD config now make use of personal Makevars files under ~/.R\n      and a site file Makevars.site, in the same way as R CMD SHLIB and\n      R CMD INSTALL.  This makes the utility more useful in package\n      configure scripts.\n\n      On Windows finding the personal files may require the environment\n      variable HOME set.\n\n      The old behaviour can be obtained with the new options\n      --no-user-files and --no-site-files.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o Alternatives to the site and user customization files\n      Makevars.site and ~/.R/Makevars can be specified _via_ the\n      environment variables R_MAKEVARS_SITE and R_MAKEVARS_USER\n      respectively.  These can be used to suppress the use of the\n      default files by setting an empty value (where possible) or a\n      non-existent path.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o sys.source() did not report error locations when keep.source =\n      TRUE.\n\n    o as.POSIXct.numeric was coercing origin using the tz argument and\n      not &quot;GMT&quot; as documented (PR#14973).\n\n    o The active binding to assign fields in reference classes has been\n      cleaned up to reduce dependence on the class' package\n      environment, also fixing bug in initializing read-only fields\n      (inspired by a report from Hadley Wickham).\n\n    o str(d) no longer gives an error when names(d) contain illegal\n      multibyte strings (PR#15247).\n\n    o Profiling of built-in functions with line.profiling= TRUE did not\n      record the line from which they were called.\n\n    o citation(pkg) dropped the header and footer specified in the\n      CITATION file (PR#15257).\n\n    o Quotes were handled differently when reading the first line and\n      reading the rest, so read.table() misread some files that\n      contained quote characters (PR#15245).\n\n    o cat() with sep a character vector of length greater than one and\n      more than one argument was using separators inconsistently\n      (PR#15261).\n\n    o On Windows in R 3.0.0, savePlot() failed because of an incorrect\n      check on the argument count.\n\n    o unzip(list = TRUE) returned Names as a factor and not a character\n      vector (as documented) for the internal method.  (Noticed by Sean\n      O'Riordain.)\n\n    o contourLines() now checks more comprehensively for conformance of\n      its x, y and z arguments (it was used incorrectly in package\n      R2G2).\n\n    o Saved graphics display lists are R version-specific.  Attempting\n      to load workspaces containing them (or some other\n      version-specific objects) aborted the load in R 3.0.0 and\n      earlier; now it does a partial load and generates a warning\n      instead.\n\n    o In R 3.0.0, identify() and locator() did not record information\n      correctly, so replaying a graph (e.g. by copying it to another\n      device) would fail. (PR#15271)\n\n    o Calling file.copy() or dirname() with the invalid input &quot;&quot; (which\n      was being used in packages, despite not being a file path) could\n      have caused a segfault.\n\n      dirname(&quot;&quot;) is now &quot;&quot; rather than &quot;.&quot; (unless it segfaulted).\n\n    o supsmu() could read/write outside its input vectors for very\n      short inputs (seen in package rms for n = 4).\n\n    o as.dendrogram()'s hclust method uses less memory and hence gets\n      considerably faster for large (n ~ 1000) clusterings, thanks to\n      Daniel M&quot;ullner. (PR#15174)\n\n    o The return value when all workers failed from\n      parallel::mclapply(mc.presechedule = TRUE) was a list of strings\n      and not of error objects.  (Spotted by Karl Forner and Bernd\n      Bischl.)\n\n    o In R 3.0.0, when help() found multiple pages with the same alias,\n      the HTML display of all the selections was not produced.\n      (PR#15282)\n\n    o splinefun(method=&quot;monoH.FC&quot;) now produces a function with first\n      argument named x and allows deriv=3, as documented. (PR#15273)\n\n    o summaryRprof() would only read the first chunksize lines of an\n      Rprof file produced with line.profiling=TRUE. By default, this is\n      the first 100 seconds.  (PR#15288)\n\n    o lsfit() produced an incorrect error message when argument x had\n      more columns than rows or x had a different number of rows than\n      y. (Spotted by Renaud Gaujoux.)\n\n    o Binary operations on equal length vectors copied the class name\n      from the second operand when the first had no class name, but did\n      not set the object bit. (PR#15299)\n\n    o The trace() method for reference generator objects failed after\n      those objects became function definitions.\n\n    o write.table() did not check that factors were constructed\n      correctly, and so caused a segment fault when writing bad ones.\n      (PR#15300)\n\n    o The internal HTTP server no longer chokes on POST requests\n      without body. It will also pass-through other request types for\n      custom handlers (with the method stored in Request-Method header)\n      instead of failing.\n\n-- \nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000562.html\">[R] Release plans: R-3.0.1 on May 16\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000564.html\">The R Journal, Volume 5, Issue 1\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#563\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#563\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#563\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#563\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

These never used to be legitimate and so were\n      treated as NA, sometimes with a warning.  They are now legal for\n      long vectors so there is no longer a warning, and x[2^31] &lt;- y\n      will now extend the vector on a 64-bit platform and give an error\n      on a 32-bit one.\n\n    o It is now possible for 64-bit builds to allocate amounts of\n      memory limited only by the OS.  It may be wise to use OS\n      facilities (e.g. ulimit in a bash shell, limit in csh), to set\n      limits on overall memory consumption of an R process,\n      particularly in a multi-user environment.  A number of packages\n      need a limit of at least 4GB of virtual memory to load.\n\n      64-bit Windows builds of R are by default limited in memory usage\n      to the amount of RAM installed: this limit can be changed by\n      command-line option --max-mem-size or setting environment\n      variable R_MAX_MEM_SIZE.\n\n    o Negative numbers for colours are consistently an error:\n      previously they were sometimes taken as transparent, sometimes\n      mapped into the current palette and sometimes an error.\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o identical() has a new argument, ignore.environment, used when\n      comparing functions (with default FALSE as before).\n\n    o There is a new option, options(CBoundsCheck=), which controls how\n      .C() and .Fortran() pass arguments to compiled code.  If true\n      (which can be enabled by setting the environment variable\n      R_C_BOUNDS_CHECK to yes), raw, integer, double and complex\n      arguments are always copied, and checked for writing off either\n      end of the array on return from the compiled code (when a second\n      copy is made).  This also checks individual elements of character\n      vectors passed to .C().\n\n      This is not intended for routine use, but can be very helpful in\n      finding segfaults in package code.\n\n    o In layout(), the limits on the grid size have been raised\n      (again).\n\n    o New simple provideDimnames() utility function.\n\n    o Where methods for length() return a double value which is\n      representable as an integer (as often happens for package\n      Matrix), this is converted to an integer.\n\n    o Matrix indexing of dataframes by two-column numeric indices is\n      now supported for replacement as well as extraction.\n\n    o setNames() now has a default for its object argument, useful for\n      a character result.\n\n    o StructTS() has a revised additive constant in the loglik\n      component of the result: the previous definition is returned as\n      the loglik0 component.  However, the help page has always warned\n      of a lack of comparability of log-likelihoods for non-stationary\n      models.  (Suggested by Jouni Helske.)\n\n    o The logic in aggregate.formula() has been revised.  It is now\n      possible to use a formula stored in a variable; previously, it\n      had to be given explicitly in the function call.\n\n    o install.packages() has a new argument quiet to reduce the amount\n      of output shown.\n\n    o Setting an element of the graphics argument lwd to a negative or\n      infinite value is now an error.  Lines corresponding to elements\n      with values NA or NaN are silently omitted.\n\n      Previously the behaviour was device-dependent.\n\n    o Setting graphical parameters cex, col, lty, lwd and pch in par()\n      now requires a length-one argument.  Previously some silently\n      took the first element of a longer vector, but not always when\n      documented to do so.\n\n    o Sys.which() when used with inputs which would be unsafe in a\n      shell (e.g. absolute paths containing spaces) now uses\n      appropriate quoting.\n\n    o as.tclObj() has been extended to handle raw vectors.  Previously,\n      it only worked in the other direction.  (Contributed by Charlie\n      Friedemann, PR#14939.)\n\n    o New functions cite() and citeNatbib() have been added, to allow\n      generation of in-text citations from &quot;bibentry&quot; objects.  A\n      cite() function may be added to bibstyle() environments.\n\n    o A sort() method has been added for &quot;bibentry&quot; objects.\n\n    o The bibstyle() function now defaults to setting the default\n      bibliography style. The getBibstyle() function has been added to\n      report the name of the current default style.\n\n    o scatter.smooth() now has an argument lpars to pass arguments to\n      lines().\n\n    o pairs() has a new log argument, to allow some or all variables to\n      be plotted on logarithmic scale.  (In part, wish of PR#14919.)\n\n    o split() gains a sep argument.\n\n    o termplot() does a better job when given a model with interactions\n      (and no longer attempts to plot interaction terms).\n\n    o The parser now incorporates code from Romain Francois' parser\n      package, to support more detailed computation on the code, such\n      as syntax highlighting, comment-based documentation, etc.\n      Functions getParseData() and getParseText() access the data.\n\n    o There is a new function rep_len() analogous to rep.int() for when\n      speed is required (and names are not).\n\n    o The undocumented use rep(NULL, length.out = n) for n &gt; 0 (which\n      returns NULL) now gives a warning.\n\n    o demo() gains an encoding argument for those packages with\n      non-ASCII demos: it defaults to the package encoding where there\n      is one.\n\n    o strwrap() converts inputs with a marked encoding to the current\n      locale: previously it made some attempt to pass through as bytes\n      inputs invalid in the current locale.\n\n    o Specifying both rate and scale to [dpqr]gamma is a warning (if\n      they are essentially the same value) or an error.\n\n    o merge() works in more cases where the data frames include\n      matrices.  (Wish of PR#14974.)\n\n    o optimize() and uniroot() no longer use a shared parameter object\n      across calls.  (nlm(), nlminb() and optim() with numerical\n      derivatives still do, as documented.)\n\n    o The all.equal() method for date-times is now documented: times\n      are regarded as equal (by default) if they differ by up to 1\n      msec.\n\n    o duplicated() and unique() gain a nmax argument which can be used\n      to make them much more efficient when it is known that there are\n      only a small number of unique entries.  This is done\n      automatically for factors.\n\n    o Functions rbinom(), rgeom(), rhyper(), rpois(), rnbinom(),\n      rsignrank() and rwilcox() now return integer (not double)\n      vectors.  This halves the storage requirements for large\n      simulations.\n\n    o sort(), sort.int() and sort.list() now use radix sorting for\n      factors of less than 100,000 levels when method is not supplied.\n      So does order() if called with a single factor, unless na.last =\n      NA.\n\n    o diag() as used to generate a diagonal matrix has been re-written\n      in C for speed and less memory usage.  It now forces the result\n      to be numeric in the case diag(x) since it is said to have 'zero\n      off-diagonal entries'.\n\n    o backsolve() (and forwardsolve()) are now internal functions, for\n      speed and support for large matrices.\n\n    o More matrix algebra functions (e.g. chol() and solve()) accept\n      logical matrices (and coerce to numeric).\n\n    o sample.int() has some support for n &gt;= 2^31: see its help for the\n      limitations.\n\n      A different algorithm is used for (n, size, replace = FALSE, prob\n      = NULL) for n &gt; 1e7 and size &lt;= n/2.  This is much faster and\n      uses less memory, but does give different results.\n\n    o approxfun() and splinefun() now return a wrapper to an internal\n      function in the stats namespace rather than a .C() or .Call()\n      call.  This is more likely to work if the function is saved and\n      used in a different session.\n\n    o The functions .C(), .Call(), .External() and .Fortran() now give\n      an error (rather than a warning) if called with a named first\n      argument.\n\n    o Sweave() by default now reports the locations in the source\n      file(s) of each chunk.\n\n    o clearPushBack() is now a documented interface to a long-existing\n      internal call.\n\n    o aspell() gains filters for R code, Debian Control Format and\n      message catalog files, and support for R level dictionaries.  In\n      addition, package utils now provides functions\n      aspell_package_R_files() and aspell_package_C_files() for spell\n      checking R and C level message strings in packages.\n\n    o bibentry() gains some support for &quot;incomplete&quot; entries with a\n      crossref field.\n\n    o gray() and gray.colors() finally allow alpha to be specified.\n\n    o monthplot() gains parameters to control the look of the reference\n      lines.  (Suggestion of Ian McLeod.)\n\n    o Added support for new %~% relation (&quot;is distributed as&quot;) in\n      plotmath.\n\n    o domain = NA is accepted by gettext() and ngettext(), analogously\n      to stop() etc.\n\n    o termplot() gains a new argument plot = FALSE which returns\n      information to allow the plots to be modified for use as part of\n      other plots, but does not plot them.  (Contributed by Terry\n      Therneau, PR#15076.)\n\n    o quartz.save(), formerly an undocumented part of R.app, is now\n      available to copy a device to a quartz() device.  dev.copy2pdf()\n      optionally does this for PDF output: quartz.save() defaults to\n      PNG.\n\n    o The default method of pairs() now allows text.panel = NULL and\n      the use of &lt;foo&gt;.panel = NULL is now documented.\n\n    o setRefClass() and getRefClass() now return class generator\n      functions, similar to setClass(), but still with the reference\n      fields and methods as before (suggestion of Romain Francois).\n\n    o New functions bitwNot(), bitwAnd(), bitwOr() and bitwXor(), using\n      the internal interfaces previously used for classes &quot;octmode&quot; and\n      &quot;hexmode&quot;.\n\n      Also bitwShiftL() and bitwShiftR() for shifting bits in elements\n      of integer vectors.\n\n    o New option &quot;deparse.cutoff&quot; to control the deparsing of language\n      objects such as calls and formulae when printing.  (Suggested by\n      a comment of Sarah Goslee.)\n\n    o colors() gains an argument distinct.\n\n    o New demo(colors) and demo(hclColors), with utility functions.\n\n    o list.files() (aka dir()) gains a new optional argument no.. which\n      allows to exclude &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; from listings.\n\n    o Multiple time series are also of class &quot;matrix&quot;; consequently,\n      head(), e.g., is more useful.\n\n    o encodeString() preserves UTF-8 marked encodings.  Thus if factor\n      levels are marked as UTF-8 an attempt is made to print them in\n      UTF-8 in RGui on Windows.\n\n    o readLines() and scan() (and hence read.table()) in a UTF-8 locale\n      now discard a UTF-8 byte-order-mark (BOM).  Such BOMs are allowed\n      but not recommended by the Unicode Standard: however Microsoft\n      applications can produce them and so they are sometimes found on\n      websites.\n\n      The encoding name &quot;UTF-8-BOM&quot; for a connection will ensure that a\n      UTF-8 BOM is discarded.\n\n    o mapply(FUN, a1, ..) now also works when a1 (or a further such\n      argument) needs a length() method (which the documented arguments\n      never do).  (Requested by Herv'e Pag`es; with a patch.)\n\n    o .onDetach() is supported as an alternative to .Last.lib.  Unlike\n      .Last.lib, this does not need to be exported from the package's\n      namespace.\n\n    o The srcfile argument to parse() may now be a character string, to\n      be used in error messages.\n\n    o The format() method for ftable objects gains a method argument,\n      propagated to write.ftable() and print(), allowing more compact\n      output, notably for LaTeX formatting, thanks to Marius Hofert.\n\n    o The utils::process.events() function has been added to trigger\n      immediate event handling.\n\n    o Sys.which() now returns NA (not &quot;&quot;) for NA inputs (related to\n      PR#15147).\n\n    o The print() method for class &quot;htest&quot; gives fewer trailing spaces\n      (wish of PR#15124).\n\n      Also print output from HoltWinters(), nls() and others.\n\n    o loadNamespace() allows a version specification to be given, and\n      this is used to check version specifications given in the Imports\n      field when a namespace is loaded.\n\n    o setClass() has a new argument, slots, clearer and less ambiguous\n      than representation.  It is recommended for future code, but\n      should be back-compatible.  At the same time, the allowed slot\n      specification is slightly more general.  See the documentation\n      for details.\n\n    o mget() now has a default for envir (the frame from which it is\n      called), for consistency with get() and assign().\n\n    o close() now returns an integer status where available, invisibly.\n      (Wish of PR#15088.)\n\n    o The internal method of tar() can now store paths too long for the\n      ustar format, using the (widely supported) GNU extension.  It can\n      also store long link names, but these are much less widely\n      supported.  There is support for larger files, up to the ustar\n      limit of 8GB.\n\n    o Local reference classes have been added to package methods.\n      These are a technique for avoiding unneeded copying of large\n      components of objects while retaining standard R functional\n      behavior.  See ?LocalReferenceClasses.\n\n    o untar() has a new argument restore_times which if false (not the\n      default) discards the times in the tarball.  This is useful if\n      they are incorrect (some tarballs submitted to CRAN have times in\n      a local timezone or many years in the past even though the\n      standard required them to be in UTC).\n\n    o replayplot() cannot (and will not attempt to) replay plots\n      recorded under R &lt; 3.0.0.  It may crash the R session if an\n      attempt is made to replay plots created in a different build of R\n      &gt;= 3.0.0.\n\n    o Palette changes get recorded on the display list, so replaying\n      plots (including when resizing screen devices and using\n      dev.copy()) will work better when the palette is changed during a\n      plot.\n\n    o chol(pivot = TRUE) now defaults to LAPACK, not LINPACK.\n\n    o The parse() function has a new parameter keep.source, which\n      defaults to options(&quot;keep.source&quot;).\n\n    o Profiling via Rprof() now optionally records information at the\n      statement level, not just the function level.\n\n    o The Rprof() function now quotes function names in in its output\n      file on Windows, to be consistent with the quoting in Unix.\n\n    o Profiling via Rprof() now optionally records information about\n      time spent in GC.\n\n    o The HTML help page for a package now displays non-vignette\n      documentation files in a more accessible format.\n\n    o To support options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE), model.frame(),\n      model.matrix() and replications() now automatically convert\n      character vectors to factors without a warning.\n\n    o The print method for objects of class &quot;table&quot; now detects tables\n      with 0-extents and prints the results as, e.g., &lt; table of extent\n      0 x 1 x 2 &gt;. (Wish of PR#15198.)\n\n    o Deparsing involving calls to anonymous functions and has been\n      made closer to reversible by the addition of extra parentheses.\n\n    o The function utils::packageName() has been added as a lightweight\n      version of methods::getPackageName().\n\n    o find.package(lib.loc = NULL) now treats loaded namespaces\n      preferentially in the same way as attached packages have been for\n      a long time.\n\n    o In Windows, the Change Directory dialog now defaults to the\n      current working directory, rather than to the last directory\n      chosen in that dialog.\n\n    o available.packages() gains a &quot;license/restricts_use&quot; filter which\n      retains only packages for which installation can proceed solely\n      based on packages which are guaranteed not to restrict use.\n\n    o New check_packages_in_dir() function in package tools for\n      conveniently checking source packages along with their reverse\n      dependencies.\n\n    o R's completion mechanism has been improved to handle help\n      requests (starting with a question mark).  In particular, help\n      prefixes are now supported, as well as quoted help topics.  To\n      support this, completion inside quotes are now handled by R by\n      default on all platforms.\n\n    o The memory manager now allows the strategy used to balance\n      garbage collection and memory growth to be controlled by setting\n      the environment variable R_GC_MEM_GROW. See ?Memory for more\n      details.\n\n    o ('For experts only', as the introductory manual says.)  The use\n      of environment variables R_NSIZE and R_VSIZE to control the\n      initial (= minimum) garbage collection trigger for number of cons\n      cels and size of heap has been restored: they can be overridden\n      by the command-line options --min-nsize and --min-vsize; see\n      ?Memory.\n\n    o On Windows, the device name for bitmap devices as reported by\n      .Device and .Devices no longer includes the file name.  This is\n      for consistency with other platforms and was requested by the\n      lattice maintainer.\n\n      win.metafile() still uses the file name: the exact form is used\n      by package tkrplot.\n\n    o set.seed(NULL) re-initializes .Random.seed as done at the\n      beginning of the session if not already set.  (Suggestion of Bill\n      Dunlap.)\n\n    o The breaks argument in hist.default() can now be a function that\n      returns the breakpoints to be used (previously it could only\n      return the suggested number of breakpoints).\n\n    o File share/licenses/licenses.db has some clarifications,\n      especially as to which variants of 'BSD' and 'MIT' is intended\n      and how to apply them to packages.  The problematic licence\n      'Artistic-1.0' has been removed.\n\n  LONG VECTORS:\n\n  This section applies only to 64-bit platforms.\n\n    o There is support for vectors longer than 2^31 - 1 elements.  This\n      applies to raw, logical, integer, double, complex and character\n      vectors, as well as lists.  (Elements of character vectors remain\n      limited to 2^31 - 1 bytes.)\n\n    o Most operations which can sensibly be done with long vectors\n      work: others may return the error 'long vectors not supported\n      yet'.  Most of these are because they explicitly work with\n      integer indices (e.g. anyDuplicated() and match()) or because\n      other limits (e.g. of character strings or matrix dimensions)\n      would be exceeded or the operations would be extremely slow.\n\n    o length() returns a double for long vectors, and lengths can be\n      set to 2^31 or more by the replacement function with a double\n      value.\n\n    o Most aspects of indexing are available.  Generally double-valued\n      indices can be used to access elements beyond 2^31 - 1.\n\n    o There is some support for matrices and arrays with each dimension\n      less than 2^31 but total number of elements more than that.  Only\n      some aspects of matrix algebra work for such matrices, often\n      taking a very long time.  In other cases the underlying Fortran\n      code has an unstated restriction (as was found for complex\n      svd()).\n\n    o dist() can produce dissimilarity objects for more than 65536 rows\n      (but for example hclust() cannot process such objects).\n\n    o serialize() to a raw vector is unlimited in size (except by\n      resources).\n\n    o The C-level function R_alloc can now allocate 2^35 or more bytes.\n\n    o agrep() and grep() will return double vectors of indices for long\n      vector inputs.\n\n    o Many calls to .C() have been replaced by .Call() to allow long\n      vectors to be supported (now or in the future).  Regrettably\n      several packages had copied the non-API .C() calls and so failed.\n\n    o .C() and .Fortran() do not accept long vector inputs.  This is a\n      precaution as it is very unlikely that existing code will have\n      been written to handle long vectors (and the R wrappers often\n      assume that length(x) is an integer).\n\n    o Most of the methods for sort() work for long vectors.\n\n      rank(), sort.list() and order() support long vectors (slowly\n      except for radix sorting).\n\n    o sample() can do uniform sampling from a long vector.\n\n  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n    o More use has been made of R objects representing registered entry\n      points, which is more efficient as the address is provided by the\n      loader once only when the package is loaded.\n\n      This has been done for packages base, methods, splines and tcltk:\n      it was already in place for the other standard packages.\n\n      Since these entry points are always accessed by the R entry\n      points they do not need to be in the load table which can be\n      substantially smaller and hence searched faster.  This does mean\n      that .C / .Fortran / .Call calls copied from earlier versions of\n      R may no longer work - but they were never part of the API.\n\n    o Many .Call() calls in package base have been migrated to\n      .Internal() calls.\n\n    o solve() makes fewer copies, especially when b is a vector rather\n      than a matrix.\n\n    o eigen() makes fewer copies if the input has dimnames.\n\n    o Most of the linear algebra functions make fewer copies when the\n      input(s) are not double (e.g. integer or logical).\n\n    o A foreign function call (.C() etc) in a package without a PACKAGE\n      argument will only look in the first DLL specified in the\n      NAMESPACE file of the package rather than searching all loaded\n      DLLs.  A few packages needed PACKAGE arguments added.\n\n    o The @&lt;- operator is now implemented as a primitive, which should\n      reduce some copying of objects when used.  Note that the operator\n      object must now be in package base: do not try to import it\n      explicitly from package methods.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o The transitional support for installing packages without\n      namespaces (required since R 2.14.0) has been removed.  R CMD\n      build will still add a namespace, but a .First.lib() function\n      will need to be converted.\n\n      R CMD INSTALL no longer adds a namespace (so installation will\n      fail), and a .First.lib() function in a package will be ignored\n      (with an installation warning for now).\n\n      As an exception, packages without a R directory and no NAMESPACE\n      file can still be installed.\n\n    o Packages can specify in their DESCRIPTION file a line like\n\n           Biarch: yes\n\n      to be installed on Windows with --force-biarch.\n\n    o Package vignettes can now be processed by other engines besides\n      Sweave; see 'Writing R Extensions' and the tools::vignetteEngine\n      help topic for details.\n\n    o The *.R tangled source code for vignettes is now included in\n      tarballs when R CMD build is used to produce them.  In R 3.0.0,\n      *.R files not in the sources will be produced at install time,\n      but eventually this will be dropped.\n\n    o The package type &quot;mac.binary&quot; now looks in a path in the\n      repository without any Mac subtype (which used to be universal or\n      leopard): it looks in bin/macosx/contrib/3.0 rather than\n      bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15).  This is the type used for the\n      CRAN binary distribution for OS X as from R 3.0.0.\n\n    o File etc/Makeconf makes more use of the macros $(CC), $(CXX),\n      $(F77) and $(FC), so the compiler in use can be changed by\n      setting just these (and if necessary the corresponding flags and\n      FLIBS) in file ~/.R/Makevars.\n\n      This is convenient for those working with binary distributions of\n      R, e.g. on OS X.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD check now gives a warning rather than a note if it finds\n      calls to abort, assert or exit in compiled code, and has been\n      able to find the .o file in which the calls occur.\n\n      Such calls can terminate the R process which loads the package.\n\n    o The location of the build and check environment files can now be\n      specified by the environment variables R_BUILD_ENVIRON and\n      R_CHECK_ENVIRON, respectively.\n\n    o R CMD Sweave gains a --compact option to control possibly\n      reducing the size of the PDF file it creates when --pdf is given.\n\n    o R CMD build now omits Eclipse's .metadata directories, and R CMD\n      check warns if it finds them.\n\n    o R CMD check now does some checks on functions defined within\n      reference classes, including of .Call() etc calls.\n\n    o R CMD check --as-cran notes assignments to the global\n      environment, calls to data() which load into the global\n      environment, and calls to attach().\n\n    o R CMD build by default uses the internal method of tar() to\n      prepare the tarball.  This is more likely to produce a tarball\n      compatible with R CMD INSTALL and R CMD check: an external tar\n      program, including options, can be specified _via_ the\n      environment variable R_BUILD_TAR.\n\n    o tools::massageExamples() is better protected against packages\n      which re-define base functions such as cat() and get() and so can\n      cause R CMD check to fail when checking examples.\n\n    o R CMD javareconf has been enhanced to be more similar to the code\n      used by configure.\n\n      There is now a test that a JNI program can be compiled (like\n      configure did) and only working settings are used.\n\n      It makes use of custom settings from configuration recorded in\n      etc/javaconf.\n\n    o The --no-vignettes argument of R CMD build has been renamed to\n      the more accurate --no-build-vignettes: its action has always\n      been to (re)build vignettes and never omitted them.\n\n      R CMD check accepts --no-build-vignettes as a preferred synonym\n      for --no-rebuild-vignettes.\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o The ENCODING argument to .C() is defunct.  Use iconv() instead.\n\n    o The .Internal(eval.with.vis) non-API function has been removed.\n\n    o Support for the converters for use with .C() has been removed,\n      including the oft misused non-API header R_ext/RConverters.h.\n\n    o The previously deprecated uses of array() with a 0-length dim\n      argument and tapply() with a 0-length INDEX list are now errors.\n\n    o Translation packages are defunct.\n\n    o Calling rep() or rep.int() on a pairlist or other non-vector\n      object is now an error.\n\n    o Several non-API entry points have been transferred to packages\n      (e.g. R_zeroin2) or replaced by different non-API entry points\n      (e.g. R_tabulate).\n\n    o The 'internal' graphics device invoked by\n      .Call(&quot;R_GD_nullDevice&quot;, package = &quot;grDevices&quot;) has been removed:\n      use pdf(file = NULL) instead.\n\n    o The .Fortran() entry point &quot;dqrls&quot; which has not been used by R\n      since version 2.15.1 is no longer available.\n\n    o Functions traceOn() and traceOff() in package methods are now\n      defunct.\n\n    o Function CRAN.packages() is finally defunct.\n\n    o Use of col2rgb(0) is defunct: use par(&quot;bg&quot;) or NA instead.\n\n    o The long-defunct functions Rd_parse(), anovalist.lm(),\n      categpry(), clearNames(), gammaCody(), glm.fit.null(),\n      lm.fit.null(), lm.wfit.null(), manglePackageNames(),\n      mauchley.test(), package.contents(), print.coefmat(),\n      reshapeLong(), reshapeWide(), tkclose(), tkcmd(), tkfile.dir(),\n      tkfile.tail(), tkopen(), tkputs(), tkread(), trySilent() and\n      zip.file.extract() have been removed entirely (but are still\n      documented in the help system).\n\n    o The unused dataPath argument to attachNamespace() has been\n      removed.\n\n    o grid.prompt() has been removed: use devAskNewPage() instead.\n\n    o The long-deprecated intensities component is no longer returned\n      by hist().\n\n    o mean() for data frames and sd() for data frames and matrices are\n      defunct.\n\n    o chol(pivot = FALSE, LINPACK = TRUE), ch2inv(LINPACK = TRUE),\n      eigen(EISPACK = TRUE), solve(LINPACK = TRUE) and svd(LINPACK =\n      TRUE) are defunct: LAPACK will be used, with a warning.\n\n    o The keep.source argument to library() and require() is defunct.\n      This option needs to be set at install time.\n\n    o Documentation for real(), as.real() and is.real() has been moved\n      to 'defunct' and the functions removed.\n\n    o The maxRasters argument of pdf() (unused since R 2.14.0) has been\n      removed.\n\n    o The unused fontsmooth argument has been removed from the quartz()\n      device.\n\n    o All the (non-API) EISPACK entry points in R have been removed.\n\n    o chol(pivot = TRUE, LINPACK = TRUE) is deprecated.\n\n    o The long-deprecated use of \\synopsis in the Usage section of .Rd\n      files will be removed in R 3.1.0.\n\n    o .find.package() and .path.package() are deprecated: only the\n      public versions without the dot have ever been in the API.\n\n    o In a package's DESCRIPTION file,\n\n          License: X11\n\n      is deprecated, since it includes 'Copyright (C) 1996 X\n      Consortium' which cannot be appropriate for a current R package.\n      Use 'MIT' or 'BSD_2_clause' instead.\n\n  CODE MIGRATION:\n\n    o The C code underlying base graphics has been migrated to the\n      graphics package (and hence no longer uses .Internal() calls).\n\n    o Most of the .Internal() calls used in the stats package have been\n      migrated to C code in that package.\n\n      This means that a number of .Internal() calls which have been\n      used by packages no longer exist, including .Internal(cor)\n      .Internal(cov), .Internal(optimhess) and\n      .Internal(update.formula).\n\n    o Some .External() calls to the base package (really to the R\n      executable or shared library) have been moved to more appropriate\n      packages.  Packages should not have been using such calls, but\n      some did (mainly those used by integrate()).\n\n  PACKAGE parallel:\n\n    o There is a new function mcaffinity() which allows getting or\n      setting the CPU affinity mask for the current R process on\n      systems that supports this (currently only Linux has been tested\n      successfully).  It has no effect on systems which do not support\n      process affinity.  Users are not expected to use this function\n      directly (with the exception of fixing libraries that break\n      affinity settings like OpenBLAS) - the function is rather\n      intended to support affinity control in high-level parallel\n      functions.  In the future, R may supplement lack of affinity\n      control in the OS by its own bookkeeping via mcaffinity() related\n      to processes and threads it spawns.\n\n    o mcparallel() has a new argument mc.affinity which attempts to set\n      the affinity of the child process according to the specification\n      contained therein.\n\n    o The port used by socket clusters is chosen randomly: this should\n      help to avoid clashes observed when two users of a multi-user\n      machine try to create a cluster at the same time.  To reproduce\n      the previous behaviour set environment variable R_PARALLEL_PORT\n      to 10187.\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o There has been some minor re-organization of the non-API header\n      files.  In particular, Rinternals.h no longer includes the\n      non-API header R_exts/PrtUtil.h, and that no longer includes\n      R_exts/Print.h.\n\n    o Passing NULL to .C() is now an error.\n\n    o .C() and .Fortran() now warn if &quot;single&quot; arguments are used with\n      DUP = FALSE, as changes to such arguments are not returned to the\n      caller.\n\n    o C entry points R_qsort and R_qsort_I now have start and end as\n      size_t to allow them to work with longer vectors on 64-bit\n      platforms.  Code using them should be recompiled.\n\n    o A few recently added C entry points were missing the remapping to\n      Rf_, notably [dpq]nbinom_mu.\n\n    o Some of the interface pointers formerly available only to R.app\n      are now available to front-ends on all Unix-alikes: one has been\n      added for the interface to View().\n\n    o PACKAGE = &quot;&quot; is now an error in .C() etc calls: it was always\n      contrary to the documentation.\n\n    o Entry point rcont2 has been migrated to package stats and so is\n      no longer available.\n\n    o R_SVN_REVISION in Rversion.h is now an integer (rather than a\n      string) and hence usable as e.g.  #if R_SVN_REVISION &lt; 70000.\n\n    o The entry points rgb2hsv and hsv2rgb have been migrated to\n      package grDevices and so are no longer available.\n\n    o R_GE_version has been increased to 10 and name2col removed (use\n      R_GE_str2col instead).  R internal colour codes are now defined\n      using the typedef rcolor.\n\n    o The REPROTECT macro now checks that the protect index is valid.\n\n    o Several non-API entry points no longer used by R have been\n      removed, including the Fortran entry points chol, chol2inv, cg,\n      ch and rg, and the C entry points Brent_fmin, fft_factor and\n      fft_work.\n\n    o If a .External call is registered with a number of arguments\n      (other than -1), the number of arguments passed is checked for\n      each call (as for other foreign function calls).\n\n    o It is now possible to write custom connection implementations\n      outside core R using R_ext/Connections.h.  Please note that the\n      implementation of connections is still considered internal and\n      may change in the future (see the above file for details).\n\n  INTERNATIONALIZATION:\n\n    o The management of translations has been converted to R code: see\n      ?tools::update_pkg_po.\n\n    o The translations for the R interpreter and RGui.exe are now part\n      of the base package (rather than having sources in directory po\n      and being installed to share/locale).  Thus the base package\n      supports three translation domains, R-base, R and RGui.\n\n    o The compiled translations which ship with R are all installed to\n      the new package translations for easier updating.  The first\n      package of that name found on .libPaths() at the start of the R\n      session will be used.  (It is possible messages will be used\n      before .libPaths() is set up in which case the default\n      translations will be used: set environment variable\n      R_TRANSLATIONS to point to the location of the intended\n      translations package to use this right from the start.)\n\n    o The translations form a separate group in the Windows installer,\n      so can be omitted if desired.\n\n    o The markup for many messages has been changed to make them easier\n      to translate, incorporating suggestions from Lukasz Daniel.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o There is again support for building without using the C 'long\n      double' type.  This is required by C99, but system\n      implementations can be slow or flawed.  Use configure option\n      --disable-long-double.\n\n    o make pdf and make install-pdf now make and install the full\n      reference index (including all base and recommended packages).\n\n    o The 'reference manual' on the Windows GUI menu and included in\n      the installer is now the full reference index, including all base\n      and recommended packages.\n\n    o R help pages and manuals have no ISBNs because ISBN rules no\n      longer allow constantly changing content to be assigned an ISBN.\n\n    o The Windows installer no longer installs a Start Menu link to the\n      static help pages; as most pages are generated dynamically, this\n      led to a lot of broken links.\n\n    o Any custom settings for Java configuration are recorded in file\n      etc/javaconf for subsequent use by R CMD javareconf.\n\n    o There is now support for makeinfo version 5.0 (which requires a\n      slightly different .texi syntax).\n\n    o The minimum versions for --use-system-zlib and --use-system-pcre\n      are now tested as 1.2.5 and 8.10 respectively.\n\n    o On Windows, the stack size is reduced to 16MB on 32-bit systems:\n      misguided users were launching many threads without controlling\n      the stack size.\n\n    o configure no longer looks for file ~/.Rconfig: ~/.R/config has\n      long been preferred.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o When R CMD build is run in an encoding other than the one\n      specified in the package's DESCRIPTION file it tries harder to\n      expand the <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">authors at R</A> field in the specified encoding.  (PR#14958)\n\n    o If R CMD INSTALL is required to expand the <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">authors at R</A> field of the\n      DESCRIPTION file, it tries harder to do so in the encoding\n      specified for the package (rather than using ASCII escapes).\n\n    o Fix in package grid for pushing a viewport into a layout cell,\n      where the layout is within a viewport that has zero physical\n      width OR where the layout has zero total relative width (likewise\n      for height).  The layout column widths (or row heights) in this\n      case were being calculated with non-finite values.  (Reported by\n      Winston Chang.)\n\n    o solve(A, b) for a vector b gave the answer names from colnames(A)\n      for LINPACK = TRUE but not in the default case.\n\n    o La.svd() accepts logical matrices (as documented, and as svd()\n      did).\n\n    o legend() now accepts negative pch values, in the same way\n      points() long has.\n\n    o Parse errors when installing files now correctly display the name\n      of the file containing the bad code.\n\n    o In Windows, tcltk windows were not always properly constructed.\n      (PR#15150)\n\n    o The internal functions implementing parse(), tools::parseLatex()\n      and tools::parse_Rd() were not reentrant, leading to errors in\n      rare circumstances such as a garbage collection triggering a\n      recursive call.\n\n    o Field assignments in reference class objects via $&lt;- were not\n      being checked because the magic incantation to turn methods on\n      for that primitive operator had been inadvertently omitted.\n\n    o setHook(hookname, value, action=&quot;replace&quot;) set the hook to be the\n      value, rather than a list containing the value as documented.\n      (PR#15167)\n\n    o If a package used a NEWS.Rd file, the main HTML package index\n      page did not link to it.  (Reported by Dirk Eddelbuettel.)\n\n    o The primitive implementation of @&lt;- was not checking the class of\n      the replacement.  It now does a check, quicker but less general\n      than slot&lt;-. See the help.\n\n    o split(x, f) now recycles classed objects x in the same way as\n      vectors.  (Reported by Martin Morgan.)\n\n    o pbeta(.28, 1/2, 2200, lower.tail=FALSE, log.p=TRUE) is no longer\n      -Inf; ditto for corresponding pt() and pf() calls, such as pt(45,\n      df=5000, lower.tail=FALSE, log.p=TRUE). (PR#15162)\n\n    o The Windows graphics device would crash R if a user attempted to\n      load the graphics history from a variable that was not a saved\n      history. (PR#15230)\n\n    o The workspace size for the predict() method for loess() could\n      exceed the maximum integer size.  (Reported by Hiroyuki\n      Kawakatsu.)\n\n    o ftable(x, row.vars, col.vars) now also works when the *.vars\n      arguments are (integer or character vectors) of length zero.\n\n    o Calling cat() on a malformed UTF-8 string could cause the Windows\n      GUI to lock up. (PR#15227)\n\n    o removeClass(cc) gave &quot;node stack overflow&quot; for some class\n      definitions containing &quot;array&quot; or &quot;matrix&quot;.\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000560.html\">R 2.15.3 is released\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000562.html\">[R] Release plans: R-3.0.1 on May 16\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#561\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#561\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#561\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#561\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is intended to be the final round-up release of the 2.15 series, and in fact of the entire 2.x.y series which started 2004-10-04.\n\nThe list below details the changes in this release.\n\nYou can get the source code from\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.15.3.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.15.3.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\nFor the R Core Team\n\nPeter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = cbf6da8f886ccd8d0dda0cc7ffd1b8ec\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = c82ec3aa971272312ca6f3f28c58d329\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 37adac6d0fbadf25b5a40e3f7535415e\nMD5 (NEWS) = 09e5c175b09d33e28023c655a11e9b8d\nMD5 (NEWS.html) = c7dccfe18e943427b85e9ddd1c7ba46b\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = b2f1a5d701f1f90679be0c60e1931a5c\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = c7cb32499ebbf85deb064aab282f93a4\nMD5 (THANKS) = 7a87321ccf0ecd2bece697e39dce5e67\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.15.3.tar.gz) = b2f1a5d701f1f90679be0c60e1931a5c\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file \n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.3:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o lgamma(x) for very small x (in the denormalized range) is no\n      longer Inf with a warning.\n\n    o image() now sorts an unsorted breaks vector, with a warning.\n\n    o The internal methods for tar() and untar() do a slightly more\n      general job for 'ustar'-style handling of paths of more than 100\n      bytes.\n\n    o Packages compiler and parallel have been added to the reference\n      index (refman.pdf).\n\n    o untar(tar = &quot;internal&quot;) has some support for pax headers as\n      produced by e.g. gnutar --posix (which seems prevalent on\n      OpenSUSE 12.2) or bsdtar --format pax, including long path and\n      link names.\n\n    o sQuote() and dQuote() now handle 0-length inputs.  (Suggestion of\n      Ben Bolker.)\n\n    o summaryRprof() returns zero-row data frames rather than throw an\n      error if no events are recorded, for consistency.\n\n    o The included version of PCRE has been updated to 8.32.\n\n    o The tcltk namespace can now be re-loaded after unloading.\n\n      The Tcl/Tk event loop is inhibited in a forked child from package\n      parallel (as in e.g. mclapply()).\n\n    o parallel::makeCluster() recognizes the value random for the\n      environment variable R_PARALLEL_PORT: this chooses a random value\n      for the port and reduces the chance of conflicts when multiple\n      users start a cluster at the same time.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o The default for TAR on Windows for R CMD build has been changed\n      to be internal if no tar command is on the path.\n\n      This enables most packages to be built 'out of the box' without\n      Rtools: the main exceptions are those which need to be installed\n      to re-build vignettes and need Rtools for installation (usually\n      because they contain compiled code).\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o On a 64-bit Windows platform with enough RAM, R_alloc can now\n      allocate up to just under 32GB like other 64-bit platforms.\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o Use of col2rgb(0) is deprecated (see the help page for its\n      limitations).\n\n    o The deprecated intensities component returned by hist() is no\n      longer recognized by the plot() method and will be removed in R\n      3.0.0.\n\n    o real(), as.real() and is.real() are now formally deprecated and\n      give a warning.\n\n    o This is formal notice that the non-API EISPACK entry points in R\n      will be removed shortly.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o The configure tests for Objective C and Objective C++ now work on\n      Mac OS 10.8 with Xcode 4.5.2 (PR#15107).\n\n    o The cairo-based versions of X11() now work with current versions\n      of cairographics (e.g. 1.12.10).  (PR#15168)\n\n      A workaround for earlier versions of R is to use X11.options(type\n      = &quot;nbcairo&quot;).\n\n    o Configuration and R CMD javareconf now come up with a smaller set\n      of library paths for Java on Oracle-format JDK (including\n      OpenJDK).  This helps avoid conflicts between libraries (such as\n      libjpeg) supplied in the JDK and system libraries.  This can\n      always be overridden if needed: see the 'R Installation and\n      Administration' manual.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o beta(a, b) could overflow to infinity in its calculations when\n      one of a and b was less than one.  (PR#15075)\n\n    o lbeta(a, b) no longer gives NaN if a or b is very small (in the\n      denormalized range).\n\n    o bquote() is now able to substitute default arguments in\n      single-argument functions.  (PR#15077)\n\n    o browseEnv(html = FALSE) would segfault if called from R (not\n      R.app) on a CRAN-style Mac OS X build of R.\n\n    o [[&lt;- for lists (generic vectors) needed to increment NAMED count\n      when RHS is used more than once. (PR#15098)\n\n    o On Windows, warnings about opening a file or pipe with a\n      non-ASCII description were sometimes output in UTF-8 rather than\n      in the current locale's character set.\n\n    o The call() function did not duplicate its arguments.  (PR#15115)\n\n    o TukeyHSD() could give NA results with some na.action methods such\n      as na.exclude().  (Hinted at on R-help by John Fox.)\n\n    o The deprecated svd(X, LINPACK = TRUE) could alter X in R\n      2.15.[12].  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o Under Windows, file.link() and file.symlink() used the link name\n      twice, so would always fail. (Reported by Rui Barradas/Oliver\n      Soong).\n\n    o summaryRprof(memory = &quot;both&quot;) mixed up the units of Vcells and\n      Ncells: it now works in bytes.  (PR#15138)\n\n    o tools::Rd2HTML() would sometimes delete text. (PR#15134)\n\n    o plot() failed for &quot;table&quot; objects containing just one entry.\n      (PR#15118)\n\n    o embedFonts() needed to quote some filepaths.  (PR#15149)\n\n    o parallel::mccollect() handled NULL returns incorrectly (removing\n      the element rather than setting it to NULL).\n\n    o The full reference index (fullrefman.pdf) was missing packages\n      compiler and parallel.\n\n    o The report for optim(method = &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, control = list(trace =\n      1)) reported the last completed and not the current iteration,\n      unlike other methods and trace levels.  (PR#15103)\n\n    o qt(1e-12, 1.2) no longer gives NaN.\n\n    o dt(1e160, 1.2, log=TRUE) no longer gives -Inf.\n\n    o On Windows the untar() function now quotes the directory name\n      when using an external tar utility, so R CMD check will handle\n      pathnames containing spaces.\n\n    o The version for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 is now\n      displayed by win.version().  (Reported by Gabor Grothendieck.)\n\n    o The custom Windows installer target myR in the installer Makefile\n      did not work in 2.15.2.  (Reported by Erich Neuwirth.)\n\n    o aperm(matrix(1:6, 2, dimnames=list(A={}, B={})), &quot;A&quot;) no longer\n      segfaults.\n\n    o Expressions involving user defined operators were not always\n      deparsed faithfully. (PR#15179)\n\n    o The enc2utf8() function converted NA_character_ to &quot;NA&quot; in\n      non-UTF-8 locales. (PR#15201)\n\n    o The exclude argument to xtabs() was ignored for &quot;factor&quot;\n      arguments.\n\n    o On Windows, work around an event-timing problem when the RGui\n      console was closed from the 'X' control and the closure\n      cancelled. (This would on some 64-bit systems crash R, typically\n      those with a slow GPU relative to the CPU.)\n\n    o On unix Rscript will pass the r_arch setting it was compiled with\n      on to the R process so that the architecture of Rscript and that\n      of R will match unless overridden.\n\n\n-- \nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000559.html\">R version 3.0.0\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000561.html\">R 3.0.0 is released\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#560\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#560\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#560\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#560\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

(Wish of PR#14961.)\n\n    o Reference class methods (in the methods package) that use other\n      methods in an indirect way (e.g., by sapply()) must tell the code\n      analysis to include that method.  They can now do so by invoking\n      $usingMethods().\n\n    o More Polish translations are available: for the RGui menus and\n      for several recommended packages.\n\n    o Multistratum MANOVA works. In fact, it seems to have done so for\n      years in spite of the help page claiming it did not.\n\n    o qqline() has new optional arguments distribution, probs and\n      qtype, following the example of lattice's panel.qqmathline().\n\n    o The handling of single quotes in the <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">en at quot</A> pseudo-language has\n      been slightly improved.  Double quotes are no longer converted.\n\n    o New functions checkPoFiles() and checkPoFile() have been added to\n      the tools package to check for consistency of format strings in\n      translation files.\n\n    o model.matrix(~1, ...) now also contains the same rownames that\n      less trivial formulae produce.  (Wish of PR#14992, changes the\n      output of several packages.)\n\n    o Misuse of rep() on undocumented types of objects (e.g. calls) is\n      now reported as an error.\n\n    o The included LAPACK has been updated to 3.4.1, with some patches\n      from the current SVN sources.  (_Inter alia_, this resolves\n      PR#14692.)\n\n    o file.copy(recursive = TRUE) has some additional checks on user\n      error leading to attempted infinite recursion (and on some\n      platforms to crashing R).\n\n    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.31, a bug-fix release.\n\n    o The included version of liblzma has been updated to version\n      5.0.4, a minor bug-fix release.\n\n    o New function .bincode(), a 'bare-bones' version of\n      cut.default(labels = FALSE) for use in packages with image()\n      methods.\n\n    o The HTML manuals now use directional single quotes.\n\n    o maintainer() now converts embedded new lines to spaces.  It no\n      longer gives a non-obvious error for non-installed packages.\n\n    o The X11() device has some protection against being used with\n      forked processes _via_ package parallel.\n\n    o Setting the environment variable R_OSX_VALGRIND (to any value)\n      allows R to be run under valgrind on Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7\n      (valgrind currently has very limited support for 10.8), provided\n      system() is not used (directly or indirectly).  This should not\n      be needed for valgrind &gt;= 3.8.1.\n\n    o The model.frame() method for &quot;lm&quot; uses xlevels: this is safer if\n      data was supplied or model = FALSE was used and the levels of\n      factors used in the fit had been re-ordered since fitting.\n\n      Similarly, model.frame(fm, data=&lt;data&gt;) copies across the\n      variables used for safe prediction from the fit.\n\n    o Functions such as parLapply() in package parallel can make use of\n      a default cluster if one is set.  (Reported by Martin Morgan.)\n\n    o chol(pivot = TRUE, LINPACK = FALSE) is now available using LAPACK\n      3.2 subroutine DPSTRF.\n\n    o The functions .C(), .Call(), .External() and .Fortran() now check\n      that they are called with an unnamed first argument: the formal\n      arguments were changed from name= to .NAME= in R 2.13.0, but some\n      packages were still using the old name.  This is currently a\n      warning, but will be an error in future.\n\n    o step() no longer tries to improve a model with AIC of -Inf (a\n      perfect fit).\n\n    o spline() and splinefun() gain a new method &quot;hyman&quot;, an\n      implementation of Hyman's method of constructing monotonic\n      interpolation splines.  (Based on contributions of Simon Wood and\n      Rob Hyndman.)\n\n    o On Windows, the C stack size has been increased to 64MB (it has\n      been 10MB since the days of 32MB RAM systems).\n\n  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n    o array() is now implemented in C code (for speed) when data is\n      atomic or an unclassed list (so it is known that as.vector(data)\n      will have no class to be used by rep()).\n\n    o rep() is faster and uses less memory, substantially so in some\n      common cases (e.g. if times is of length one or length.out is\n      given, and each = 1).\n\n    o findInterval(), tabulate(), cut(), hist() and image.default() all\n      use .Call() and are more efficient.\n\n    o duplicated(), unique() and similar now support vectors of lengths\n      above 2^29 on 64-bit platforms.\n\n    o Omitting PACKAGE in .C() etc calls was supposed to make use of\n      the DLL from the namespace within which the enclosing function\n      was defined.  It was less successful in doing so than it might\n      be, and gave no indication it had failed.\n\n      A new search strategy is very successful and gives a warning when\n      it fails.  In most cases this is because the entry point is not\n      actually provided by that package (and so PACKAGE should be used\n      to indicate which package is intended) but in some the namespace\n      does not have a DLL specified by a useDynLib() directive so\n      PACKAGE is required.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD check now checks if a package can be loaded by\n      library(pkgname, lib.loc = &quot;somewhere&quot;) without being on the\n      library search path (unless it is already installed in .Library,\n      when it always will be).\n\n    o R CMD check --as-cran notes 'hidden' files and directories (with\n      names starting with a dot) that are not needed for the operation\n      of R CMD INSTALL or R CMD build: such files should be excluded\n      from the published tarball.\n\n    o R CMD check (if checking subdirectories) checks that the R code\n      in any demos is ASCII and can be parsed, and warns if not.\n\n    o When R CMD Rd2pdf is used with inputenx.sty, it allows further\n      characters (mainly for Eastern European languages) by including\n      ix-utf8enc.dfu (if available).  (Wish of PR#14989.)\n\n    o R CMD build now omits several types of hidden files/directories,\n      including inst/doc/.Rinstignore, vignettes/.Rinstignore,\n      (.Rinstignore should be at top level), .deps under src,\n      .Renviron, .Rprofile, .Rproj.user, .backups, .cvsignore,\n      .cproject, .directory, .dropbox, .exrc, .gdb.history,\n      .gitattributes, .gitignore, .gitmodules, .hgignore, .hgtags,\n      .htaccess, .latex2html-init, .project, .seed, .settings,\n      .tm_properties and various leftovers.\n\n    o R CMD check now checks for .C(), .Call(), .External() and\n      .Fortran() calls in other packages, and gives a warning on those\n      found from R itself (which are not part of the API and change\n      without notice: many will changed for R 2.16.0).\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o The limit for R_alloc on 64-bit platforms has been raised to just\n      under 32GB (from just under 16GB).\n\n    o The misuse of .C(&quot;name&quot;, ..., PACKAGE = foo) where foo is an\n      arbitrary R object is now an error.\n\n      The misuse .C(&quot;name&quot;,..., PACKAGE = &quot;&quot;) is now warned about in R\n      CMD check, and will be an error in future.\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o Use of array() with a 0-length dim argument is deprecated with a\n      warning (and was contrary to the documentation).\n\n    o Use of tapply() with a 0-length INDEX list is deprecated with a\n      warning.\n\n    o Translation packages are deprecated.\n\n    o Calling rep() or rep.int() on a pairlist is deprecated and will\n      give a warning.  In any case, rep() converted a pairlist to a\n      list so you may as well do that explicitly.\n\n    o Entry point rcont2 is no longer part of the API, and will move to\n      package stats in R 2.16.0.\n\n    o The 'internal' graphics device invoked by\n      .Call(&quot;R_GD_nullDevice&quot;, package = &quot;grDevices&quot;) is about to be\n      removed: use pdf(file = NULL) instead.\n\n    o eigen(EISPACK = TRUE), chol(pivot = FALSE, LINPACK = TRUE),\n      chol2inv(LINPACK = TRUE), solve(LINPACK = TRUE) and svd(LINPACK =\n      TRUE) are deprecated and give a warning.\n\n      They were provided for compatibility with R 1.7.0 (Mar 2003)!\n\n    o The 'internal function' kappa.tri() has been renamed to\n      .kappa_tri() so it is not inadvertently called as a method for\n      class &quot;tri&quot;.\n\n    o Functions sessionData() and browseAll() in package methods are on\n      a help page describing them as 'deprecated' and are now formally\n      deprecated.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o For a Windows or Mac OS X binary package install,\n      install.packages() will check if a source package is available on\n      the same repositories, and report if it is a later version or\n      there is a source package but no binary package available.\n\n      This check can be suppressed: see the help page.\n\n    o install.packages(type = &quot;both&quot;) has been enhanced.  In\n      interactive use it will ask whether to choose the source version\n      of a package if the binary version is older and contains compiled\n      code, and also asks if source packages with no binary version\n      should be installed).\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o There is a new configure option --with-libtiff (mainly in case\n      the system installation needs to be avoided).\n\n    o LAPACK 3.4.1 does use some Fortran 90 features, so g77 no longer\n      suffices.\n\n    o If an external LAPACK is used, it must be version 3.2 or later.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o On Windows, starting Rterm via R.exe caused Ctrl-C to misbehave.\n      (PR#14948)\n\n    o The tools::latexToUtf8() function missed conversions that were\n      contained within braces.\n\n    o Long timezone specifications (such as a file name preceded by :)\n      could crash as.POSIXlt.  (PR#14945)\n\n    o R CMD build --resave-data could fail if there was no data\n      directory but there was an R/sysdata.rda file.  (PR#14947)\n\n    o is.na() misbehaved on a 0-column data frame.  (PR#14959)\n\n    o anova.lmlist() failed if test was supplied.  (PR#14960)\n\n      It was unable to compute Cp tests for object of class &quot;lm&quot; (it\n      assumed class &quot;glm&quot;).\n\n    o The formula method for sunflowerplot() now allows xlab and ylab\n      to be set.  (Reported by Gerrit Eichner.)\n\n    o The &quot;POSIXt&quot; and &quot;Date&quot; methods for hist() could fail on Windows\n      where adjustments to the right-hand boundary crossed a DST\n      transition time.\n\n    o On Windows, the code in as.POSIXct() to handle incorrectly\n      specified isdst fields might have resulted in NA being returned.\n\n    o aov() and manova() gave spurious warning about singular error\n      model in the multiresponse case.\n\n    o In ns() and bs(), specifying knots = NULL is now equivalent to\n      omitting it, also when df is specified.  (PR#14970)\n\n    o sprintf() did not accept numbered arguments ending in zero.\n      (PR#14975)\n\n    o rWishart() could overflow the C stack and maybe crash the R\n      process for dimensions of several hundreds or more.  (Reported by\n      Michael Braun on R-sig-mac.)\n\n    o Base package vignettes (e.g. vignette(&quot;Sweave&quot;)) were not fully\n      installed in builds of R from the tarball.\n\n    o lchoose() and choose() could overflow the C stack and crash R.\n\n    o When given a 0-byte file and asked to keep source references,\n      parse() read input from stdin() instead.\n\n    o pdf(compress = TRUE) did not delete temporary files it created\n      until the end of the R session.  (PR#14991)\n\n    o logLik() did not detect the error of applying it to a\n      multiple-response linear model.  (PR#15000)\n\n    o file.copy(recursive = TRUE) did not always report FALSE for a\n      failure two or more directories deep.\n\n    o qgeom() could return -1 for extremely small q. (PR#14967.)\n\n    o smooth.spline() used DUP = FALSE which allowed its compiled C\n      code to change the function: this was masked by the default\n      byte-compilation. (PR#14965.)\n\n    o In Windows, the GUI preferences for foreground color were not\n      always respected.  (Reported by Benjamin Wells.)\n\n    o On OS X, the Quartz versions of the bitmap devices did not\n      respect antialias = &quot;none&quot;.  (PR#15006.)\n\n    o unique() and similar would infinite-loop if called on a vector of\n      length &gt; 2^29 (but reported that the vector was too long for 2^30\n      or more).\n\n    o parallel::stopCluster() now works with MPI clusters without snow\n      being on the search path.\n\n    o terms.formula() could exhaust the stack, and the stack check did\n      not always catch this before the segfault.  (PR#15013)\n\n    o sort.list(method = &quot;radix&quot;) could give incorrect results on\n      certain compilers (seen with clang on Mac OS 10.7 and Xcode\n      4.4.1).\n\n    o backsolve(T, b) gave incorrect results when nrows(b) &gt; ncols(T)\n      and b had more than one column.\n\n      It could segfault or give nonsense if k was specified as more\n      than ncols(T).\n\n    o smooth.spline() did not check that a specified numeric spar was\n      of length 1, and gave corrupt results if it was of length 0.\n\n    o Protection added to do_system. (PR#15025)\n\n    o Printing of vectors with names &gt; 1000 characters now works\n      correctly rather than truncating. (PR#15028)\n\n    o qr() for a complex matrix did not pivot the column names.\n\n    o --with-blas='-framework vecLib' now also works on OS X 10.8.\n\n    o R CMD check no longer fails with an error if a DESCRIPTION file\n      incorrectly contains a blank line.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o install.packages(type = &quot;both&quot;) could call chooseCRANmirror()\n      twice.\n\n    o lm.wfit() could segfault in R 2.15.1 if all the weights were\n      zero. (PR#15044)\n\n    o A malformed package name could cause R CMD INSTALL to write\n      outside the target library.\n\n    o Some of the quality control functions (e.g. tools::checkFF())\n      were wrongly identifying the source of S4 methods in a package\n      and so not checking them.\n\n    o The default type of display by browseEnv() when using R.app on\n      Mac OS X has been incorrect for a long time.\n\n    o The implementation of importMethodsFrom in a NAMESPACE file could\n      be confused and fail to find generics when importing from\n      multiple packages (reported and fixed by Michael Lawrence).\n\n    o The detection of the C stack direction is better protected\n      against compiler optimization. (PR#15011.)\n\n    o Long custom line types would sometimes segfault on the\n      cairographics-based devices. (PR#15055.)\n\n    o tools::checkPoFile() unprotected too early in its C code and so\n      segfaulted from time to time.\n\n    o The Fortran code underlying nlminb() could infinite-loop if any\n      of the input functions returned NA or NaN.  This is now an error\n      for the gradient or Hessian, and a warning for the function (with\n      the value replaced by Inf).  (In part, PR#15052.)\n\n    o The code for creating coerce() methods could generate false notes\n      about ambiguous selection; the notes have been suppressed for\n      this function.\n\n    o arima.sim() could give too long an output in some corner cases\n      (in part, PR#15068).\n\n    o anova.glm() with test = &quot;Rao&quot; didn't work when models included an\n      offset. (Reported by Soren Feodor Nielsen.)\n\n    o as.data.frame.matrix() could return invalid data frame with no\n      row.names attribute for 0-row matrix. (Reported by Herv'e Pag`es.)\n\n    o Compilation with the vecLib or Accelerate frameworks on OS X\n      without using that also for LAPACK is more likely to be\n      successful.\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000556.html\">[R] Release plans: R-2.15.2 on October 26\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000558.html\">The R Journal, Volume 4, Issue 2\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#557\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#557\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#557\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#557\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This sometimes alters tracebacks\n      slightly.\n\n    o install.packages(&quot;pkg_version.tgz&quot;) on Mac OS X now has sanity\n      checks that this is actually a binary package (as people have\n      tried it with incorrectly named source packages).\n\n    o splineDesign() and spline.des() in package splines have a new\n      option sparse which can be used for efficient construction of a\n      sparse B-spline design matrix (_via_ Matrix).\n\n    o norm() now allows type = &quot;2&quot; (the 'spectral' or 2-norm) as well,\n      mainly for didactical completeness.\n\n    o pmin() and pmax()) now also work when one of the inputs is of\n      length zero and others are not, returning a zero-length vector,\n      analogously to, say, +.\n\n    o colorRamp() (and hence colorRampPalette()) now also works for the\n      boundary case of just one color when the ramp is flat.\n\n    o qqline() has new optional arguments distribution, probs and\n      qtype, following the example of lattice's panel.qqmathline().\n\n    o .C() gains some protection against the misuse of character vector\n      arguments.  (An all too common error is to pass character(N),\n      which initializes the elements to &quot;&quot;, and then attempt to edit\n      the strings in-place, sometimes forgetting to terminate them.)\n\n    o Calls to the new function globalVariables() in package utils\n      declare that functions and other objects in a package should be\n      treated as globally defined, so that CMD check will not note\n      them.\n\n    o print(packageDescription(*)) trims the Collate field by default.\n\n    o The included copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.7.\n\n    o A new option &quot;show.error.locations&quot; has been added.  When set to\n      TRUE, error messages will contain the location of the most recent\n      call containing source reference information. (Other values are\n      supported as well; see ?options.)\n\n    o The NA warning messages from e.g. pchisq() now report the call to\n      the closure and not that of the .Internal.\n\n    o Added Polish translations by &lt;c5&gt;&lt;81&gt;ukasz Daniel.\n\n  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n    o In package parallel, makeForkCluster() and the multicore-based\n      functions use native byte-order for serialization (deferred from\n      2.15.0).\n\n    o lm.fit(), lm.wfit(), glm.fit() and lsfit() do less copying of\n      objects, mainly by using .Call() rather than .Fortran().\n\n    o .C() and .Fortran() do less copying: arguments which are raw,\n      logical, integer, real or complex vectors and are unnamed are not\n      copied before the call, and (named or not) are not copied after\n      the call.  Lists are no longer copied (they are supposed to be\n      used read-only in the C code).\n\n    o tabulate() makes use of .C(DUP = FALSE) and hence does not copy\n      bin.  (Suggested by Tim Hesterberg.)  It also avoids making a\n      copy of a factor argument bin.\n\n    o Other functions (often or always) doing less copying include\n      cut(), dist(), the complex case of eigen(), hclust(), image(),\n      kmeans(), loess(), stl() and svd(LINPACK = TRUE).\n\n    o There is less copying when using primitive replacement functions\n      such as names(), attr() and attributes().\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o The converters for use with .C() (see ?getCConverterDescriptions)\n      are deprecated: use the .Call() interface instead.  There are no\n      known examples (they were never fully documented).\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o For R CMD check, a few people have reported problems with\n      junctions on Windows (although they were tested on Windows 7, XP\n      and Server 2008 machines and it is unknown under what\n      circumstances the problems occur).  Setting the environment\n      variable R_WIN_NO_JUNCTIONS to a non-empty value (e.g. in\n      ~/.R/check.Renviron) will force copies to be used instead.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL with _R_CHECK_INSTALL_DEPENDS_ set to a true value\n      (as done by R CMD check --as-cran) now restricts the packages\n      available when lazy-loading as well as when test-loading (since\n      packages such as ETLUtils and agsemisc had top-level calls to\n      library() for undeclared packages).\n\n      This check is now also available on Windows.\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o C entry points mkChar and mkCharCE now check that the length of\n      the string they are passed does not exceed 2^31-1 bytes: they\n      used to overflow with unpredictable consequences.\n\n    o C entry points R_GetCurrentSrcref and R_GetSrcFilename have been\n      added to the API to allow debuggers access to the source\n      references on the stack.\n\n  WINDOWS-SPECIFIC CHANGES:\n\n    o Windows-specific changes will now be announced in this file\n      (NEWS).  Changes up and including R 2.15.0 remain in the CHANGES\n      file.\n\n    o There are two new environment variables which control the\n      defaults for command-line options.\n\n      If R_WIN_INTERNET2 is set to a non-empty value, it is as if\n      --internet2 was used.\n\n      If R_MAX_MEM_SIZE is set, it gives the default memory limit if\n      --max-mem-size is not specified: invalid values being ignored.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o lsfit() lost the names from the residuals.\n\n    o More cases in which merge() could create a data frame with\n      duplicate column names now give warnings.  Cases where names\n      specified in by match multiple columns are errors.\n\n    o Nonsense uses such as seq(1:50, by = 5) (from package plotrix)\n      and seq.int(1:50, by = 5) are now errors.\n\n    o The residuals in the 5-number summary printed by summary() on an\n      &quot;lm&quot; object are now explicitly labelled as weighted residuals\n      when non-constant weights are present.  (Wish of PR#14840.)\n\n    o tracemem() reported that all objects were copied by .C() or\n      .Fortran() whereas only some object types were ever copied.\n\n      It also reported and marked as copies _some_ transformations such\n      as rexp(n, x): it no longer does so.\n\n    o The plot() method for class &quot;stepfun&quot; only used the optional xval\n      argument to compute xlim and not the points at which to plot (as\n      documented).  (PR#14864)\n\n    o Names containing characters which need to be escaped were not\n      deparsed properly.  (PR#14846)\n\n    o Trying to update (recommended) packages in R_HOME/library without\n      write access is now dealt with more gracefully.  Further, such\n      package updates may be skipped (with a warning), when a newer\n      installed version is already going to be used from .libPaths().\n      (PR#14866)\n\n    o hclust() is now fast again (as up to end of 2003), with a\n      different fix for the &quot;median&quot;/&quot;centroid&quot; problem.  (PR#4195).\n\n    o get_all_vars() failed when the data came entirely from vectors in\n      the global environment. (PR#14847)\n\n    o R CMD check with _R_CHECK_NO_RECOMMENDED_ set to a true value (as\n      done by the --as-cran option) could issue false errors if there\n      was an indirect dependency on a recommended package.\n\n    o formatC() uses the C entry point str_signif which could write\n      beyond the length allocated for the output string.\n\n    o Missing default argument added to implicit S4 generic for\n      backsolve(). (PR#14883)\n\n    o Some bugs have been fixed in handling load actions that could\n      fail to export assigned items or generate spurious warnings in\n      CMD check on loading.\n\n    o For tiff(type = &quot;windows&quot;), the numbering of per-page files\n      except the last was off by one.\n\n    o On Windows, loading package stats (which is done for a default\n      session) would switch line endings on stdout and stderr from CRLF\n      to LF.  This affected Rterm and R CMD BATCH.\n\n    o On Windows, the compatibility function x11() had not kept up with\n      changes to windows(), and issued warnings about bad parameters.\n      (PR#14880)\n\n    o On Windows, the Sys.glob() function did not handle UNC paths as\n      it was designed to try to do. (PR#14884)\n\n    o In package parallel, clusterApply() and similar failed to handle\n      a (pretty pointless) length-1 argument. (PR#14898)\n\n    o Quartz Cocoa display reacted asynchronously to dev.flush() which\n      means that the redraw could be performed after the plot has been\n      already modified by subsequent code. The redraw is now done\n      synchronously in dev.flush() to allow animations without sleep\n      cycles.\n\n    o Source locations reported in traceback() were incorrect when\n      byte-compiled code was on the stack.\n\n    o plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE) no longer underflows early\n      for large x (e.g. 800).\n\n    o ?Arithmetic's &quot;1 ^ y and y ^ 0 are 1, _always_&quot; now also applies\n      for integer vectors y.\n\n    o X11-based pixmap devices like png(type = &quot;Xlib&quot;) were trying to\n      set the cursor style, which triggered some warnings and hangs.\n\n    o Code executed by the built-in HTTP server no longer allows other\n      HTTP clients to re-enter R until the current worker evaluation\n      finishes, to prevent cascades.\n\n    o The plot() and Axis() methods for class &quot;table&quot; now respect\n      graphical parameters such as cex.axis.  (Reported by Martin\n      Becker.)\n\n    o Under some circumstances package.skeleton() would give out\n      progress reports that could not be translated and so were\n      displayed by question marks.  Now they are always in English.\n      (This was seen for CJK locales on Windows, but may have occurred\n      elsewhere.)\n\n    o The evaluator now keeps track of source references outside of\n      functions, e.g. when source() executes a script.\n\n    o The replacement method for window() now works correctly for\n      multiple time series of class &quot;mts&quot;.  (PR#14925)\n\n    o is.unsorted() gave incorrect results on non-atomic objects such\n      as data frames.  (Reported by Matthew Dowle.)\n\n    o The value returned by tools::psnice() for invalid pid values was\n      not always NA as documented.\n\n    o Closing an X11() window while locator() was active could abort\n      the R process.\n\n    o getMethod(f, sig) produced an incorrect error message in some\n      cases when f was not a string).\n\n    o Using a string as a &quot;call&quot; in an error condition with\n      options(showErrorCalls=TRUE) could cause a segfault.  (PR#14931)\n\n    o The string &quot;infinity&quot; allowed by C99 was not accepted as a\n      numerical string value by e.g. scan() and as.character().\n      (PR#14933)\n\n    o In legend(), setting some entries of lwd to NA was inconsistent\n      (depending on the graphics device) in whether it would suppress\n      those lines; now it consistently does so.  (PR#14926)\n\n    o by() failed for a zero-row data frame.  (Reported by Weiqiang\n      Qian)\n\n    o Yates correction in chisq.test() could be bigger than the terms\n      it corrected, previously leading to an infinite test statistic in\n      some corner cases which are now reported as NaN.\n\n    o xgettext() and related functions sometimes returned items that\n      were not strings for translation. (PR#14935)\n\n    o plot(&lt;lm&gt;, which=5) now correctly labels the factor level\n      combinations for the special case where all h[i,i] are the same.\n      (PR#14837)\n\n \n-- \nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000553.html\">Release plans: R-2.15.1 on June 22\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000555.html\">The R Journal, Vol. 4 Issue 1\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#554\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#554\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#554\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#554\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is the first release of the 2.15 series and contains several new features and changes; see the list below for details.\n\nYou can get the source code from\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.15.0.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.15.0.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\nFor the R Core Team\n\nPeter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = cbf6da8f886ccd8d0dda0cc7ffd1b8ec\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = c6cf7cff235e9bd3c823e6a1a3d76cd5\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 37adac6d0fbadf25b5a40e3f7535415e\nMD5 (NEWS) = 31dee994d35636656c9e254bfb819d7c\nMD5 (NEWS.html) = 0551e23b675fa9dc709830d1a4ee738c\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = 905f638990492618559202cc1e48a867\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = a7a02d98a407c3cb8674d067608f14fc\nMD5 (THANKS) = 159efc7bd4ae7b23dda07c1d431657bc\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.15.0.tar.gz) = 905f638990492618559202cc1e48a867\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.15.0:\n\n  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:\n\n    o The behaviour of unlink(recursive = TRUE) for a symbolic link to\n      a directory has changed: it now removes the link rather than the\n      directory contents (just as rm -r does).\n\n      On Windows it no longer follows reparse points (including\n      junctions and symbolic links).\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o Environment variable RD2DVI_INPUTENC has been renamed to\n      RD2PDF_INPUTENC.\n\n    o .Deprecated() becomes a bit more flexible, getting an old\n      argument.\n\n    o Even data-only packages without R code need a namespace and so\n      may need to be installed under R 2.14.0 or later.\n\n    o assignInNamespace() has further restrictions on use apart from at\n      top-level, as its help page has warned.  Expect it to be disabled\n      from programmatic use in the future.\n\n    o system() and system2() when capturing output report a non-zero\n      status in the new &quot;status&quot; attribute.\n\n    o kronecker() now has an S4 generic in package methods on which\n      packages can set methods.  It will be invoked by X %x% Y if\n      either X or Y is an S4 object.\n\n    o pdf() accepts forms like file = &quot;|lpr&quot; in the same way as\n      postscript().\n\n    o pdf() accepts file = NULL.  This means that the device does NOT\n      create a PDF file (but it can still be queried, e.g., for font\n      metric info).\n\n    o format() (and hence print()) on &quot;bibentry&quot; objects now uses\n      options(&quot;width&quot;) to set the output width.\n\n    o legend() gains a text.font argument. (Suggested by Tim Paine,\n      PR#14719.)\n\n    o nchar() and nzchar() no longer accept factors (as integer\n      vectors).  (Wish of PR#6899.)\n\n    o summary() behaves slightly differently (or more precisely, its\n      print() method does).  For numeric inputs, the number of NAs is\n      printed as an integer and not a real.  For dates and datetimes,\n      the number of NAs is included in the printed output (the latter\n      being the wish of PR#14720).\n\n      The &quot;data.frame&quot; method is more consistent with the default\n      method: in particular it now applies zapsmall() to\n      numeric/complex summaries.\n\n    o The number of items retained with options(warn = 0) can be set by\n      options(nwarnings=).\n\n    o There is a new function assignInMyNamespace() which uses the\n      namespace of the function it is called from.\n\n    o attach() allows the default name for an attached file to be\n      overridden.\n\n    o bxp(), the work horse of boxplot(), now uses a more sensible\n      default xlim in the case where at is specified differently from\n      1:n, see the discussion on R-devel, &lt;URL:\n      <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-November/062586.html\">https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2011-November/062586.html</A>&gt;.\n\n    o New function paste0(), an efficient version of paste(*, sep=&quot;&quot;),\n      to be used in many places for more concise (and slightly more\n      efficient) code.\n\n    o Function setClass() in package methods now returns, invisibly, a\n      generator function for the new class, slightly preferred to\n      calling new(), as explained on the setClass help page.\n\n    o The &quot;dendrogram&quot; method of str() now takes its default for\n      last.str from option str.dendrogram.last.\n\n    o New simple fitted() method for &quot;kmeans&quot; objects.\n\n    o The traceback() function can now be called with an integer\n      argument, to display a current stack trace. (Wish of PR#14770.)\n\n    o setGeneric() calls can be simplified when creating a new generic\n      function by supplying the default method as the def argument.\n      See ?setGeneric.\n\n    o serialize() has a new option xdr = FALSE which will use the\n      native byte-order for binary serializations.  In scenarios where\n      only little-endian machines are involved (these days, close to\n      universal) and (un)serialization takes an appreciable amount of\n      time this may speed up noticeably transferring data between\n      systems.\n\n    o The internal (un)serialization code is faster for long vectors,\n      particularly with XDR on some platforms.  (Based on a suggested\n      patch by Michael Spiegel.)\n\n    o For consistency, circles with zero radius are omitted by points()\n      and grid.circle().  Previously this was device-dependent, but\n      they were usually invisible.\n\n    o NROW(x) and NCOL(x) now work whenever dim(x) looks appropriate,\n      e.g., also for more generalized matrices.\n\n    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.30.\n\n    o The internal R_Srcref variable is now updated before the browser\n      stops on entering a function.  (Suggestion of PR#14818.)\n\n    o There are 'bare-bones' functions .colSums(), .rowSums(),\n      .colMeans() and .rowMeans() for use in programming where ultimate\n      speed is required.\n\n    o The formerly internal function .package_dependencies() from\n      package tools for calculating (recursive) (reverse) dependencies\n      on package databases has been renamed to package_dependencies()\n      and is now exported.\n\n    o There is a new function optimHess() to compute the (approximate)\n      Hessian for an optim() solution if hessian = TRUE was forgotten.\n\n    o .filled.contour() is a 'bare-bones' function to add a\n      filled-contour rectangular plot to an already prepared plot\n      region.\n\n    o The stepping in debugging and single-step browsing modes has\n      changed slightly: now left braces at the start of the body are\n      stepped over for if statements as well as for for and while\n      statements.  (Wish of PR#14814.)\n\n    o library() no longer warns about a conflict with a function from\n      package:base if the function has the same code as the base one\n      but with a different environment.  (An example is Matrix::det().)\n\n    o When deparsing very large language objects, as.character() now\n      inserts newlines after each line of approximately 500 bytes,\n      rather than truncating to the first line.\n\n    o New function rWishart() generates Wishart-distributed random\n      matrices.\n\n    o Packages may now specify actions to be taken when the package is\n      loaded (setLoadActions()).\n\n    o options(max.print = Inf) and similar now give an error (instead\n      of warnings later).\n\n    o The &quot;difftime&quot; replacement method of units tries harder to\n      preserve other attributes of the argument.  (Wish of PR#14839.)\n\n    o poly(raw = TRUE) no longer requires more unique points than the\n      degree.  (Requested by John Fox.)\n\n  PACKAGE parallel:\n\n    o There is a new function mcmapply(), a parallel version of\n      mapply(), and a wrapper mcMap(), a parallel version of Map().\n\n    o A default cluster can be registered by the new function\n      setDefaultCluster(): this will be used by default in functions\n      such as parLapply().\n\n    o clusterMap() has a new argument .scheduling to allow the use of\n      load-balancing.\n\n    o There are new load-balancing functions parLapplyLB() and\n      parSapplyLB().\n\n    o makePSOCKCluster() has a new option useXDR = FALSE which can be\n      used to avoid byte-shuffling for serialization when all the nodes\n      are known to be little-endian (or all big-endian).\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o Non-ASCII vignettes without a declared encoding are no longer\n      accepted.\n\n    o C/C++ code in packages is now compiled with -NDEBUG to mitigate\n      against the C/C++ function assert being called in production use.\n      Developers can turn this off during package development with\n      PKG_CPPFLAGS = -UNDEBUG.\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL has a new option --dsym which on Mac OS X (Darwin)\n      dumps the symbols alongside the .so file: this is helpful when\n      debugging with valgrind (and especially when installing packages\n      into R.framework).  [This can also be enabled by setting the\n      undocumented environment variable PKG_MAKE_DSYM, since R 2.12.0.]\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL will test loading under all installed\n      sub-architectures even for packages without compiled code, unless\n      the flag --no-multiarch is used.  (Pure R packages can do things\n      which are architecture-dependent: in the case which prompted\n      this, looking for an icon in a Windows R executable.)\n\n    o There is a new option install.packages(type = &quot;both&quot;) which tries\n      source packages if binary packages are not available, on those\n      platforms where the latter is the default.\n\n    o The meaning of install.packages(dependencies = TRUE) has changed:\n      it now means to install the essential dependencies of the named\n      packages plus the Suggests, but only the essential dependencies\n      of dependencies.  To get the previous behaviour, specify\n      dependencies as a character vector.\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch is now supported on OS X and\n      other Unix-alikes using multiple sub-architectures.\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL --libs-only now by default does a test load on\n      Unix-alikes as well as on Windows: suppress with --no-test-load.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD check now gives a warning rather than a note if it finds\n      inefficiently compressed datasets.  With bzip2 and xz compression\n      having been available since R 2.10.0, it only exceptionally makes\n      sense to not use them.\n\n      The environment variable _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_ is no longer\n      consulted: the check is always done if _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA_ has\n      a true value (its default).\n\n    o Where multiple sub-architectures are to be tested, R CMD check\n      now runs the examples and tests for all the sub-architectures\n      even if one fails.\n\n    o R CMD check can optionally report timings on various parts of the\n      check: this is controlled by environment variable\n      _R_CHECK_TIMINGS_ documented in 'Writing R Extensions'.  Timings\n      (in the style of R CMD BATCH) are given at the foot of the output\n      files from running each test and the R code in each vignette.\n\n    o There are new options for more rigorous testing by R CMD check\n      selected by environment variables - see the 'Writing R\n      Extensions' manual.\n\n    o R CMD check now warns (rather than notes) on undeclared use of\n      other packages in examples and tests: increasingly people are\n      using the metadata in the DESCRIPTION file to compute information\n      about packages, for example reverse dependencies.\n\n    o The defaults for some of the options in R CMD check (described in\n      the 'R Internals' manual) have changed: checks for unsafe and\n      .Internal() calls and for partial matching of arguments in R\n      function calls are now done by default.\n\n    o R CMD check has more comprehensive facilities for checking\n      compiled code and so gives fewer reports on entry points linked\n      into .so/.dll files from libraries (including C++ and Fortran\n      runtimes).\n\n      Checking compiled code is now done on FreeBSD (as well as the\n      existing supported platforms of Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and\n      Windows).\n\n    o R CMD build has more options for --compact-vignettes: see R CMD\n      build --help.\n\n    o R CMD build has a new option --md5 to add an MD5 file (as done by\n      CRAN): this is used by R CMD INSTALL to check the integrity of\n      the distribution.\n\n      If this option is not specified, any existing (and probably\n      stale) MD5 file is removed.\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o R CMD Rd2dvi is now defunct: use R CMD Rd2pdf.\n\n    o Options such --max-nsize, --max-vsize and the function\n      mem.limits() are now defunct.  (Options --min-nsize and\n      --min-vsize remain available.)\n\n    o Use of library.dynam() without specifying all the first three\n      arguments is now disallowed.\n\n      Use of an argument chname in library.dynam() including the\n      extension .so or .dll (which was never allowed according to the\n      help page) is defunct.  This also applies to\n      library.dynam.unload() and to useDynLib directives in NAMESPACE\n      files.\n\n    o The internal functions .readRDS() and .saveRDS() are now defunct.\n\n    o The off-line help() types &quot;postscript&quot; and &quot;ps&quot; are defunct.\n\n    o Sys.putenv(), replaced and deprecated in R 2.5.0, is finally\n      removed.\n\n    o Some functions/objects which have been defunct for five or more\n      years have been removed completely.  These include .Alias(),\n      La.chol(), La.chol2inv(), La.eigen(), Machine(), Platform(),\n      Version, codes(), delay(), format.char(), getenv(), httpclient(),\n      loadURL(), machine(), parse.dcf(), printNoClass(), provide(),\n      read.table.url(), restart(), scan.url(), symbol.C(), symbol.For()\n      and unix().\n\n    o The ENCODING argument to .C() is deprecated.  It was intended to\n      smooth the transition to multi-byte character strings, but can be\n      replaced by the use of iconv() in the rare cases where it is\n      still needed.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o Building with a positive value of --with-valgrind-instrumentation\n      now also instruments logical, complex and raw vectors.\n\n    o There is experimental support for _link-time optimization_ with\n      gcc 4.5.0 or later on platforms which support it.\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o Passing R objects other than atomic vectors, functions, lists and\n      environments to .C() is now deprecated and will give a warning.\n      Most cases (especially NULL) are actually coding errors.  NULL\n      will be disallowed in future.\n\n      .C() now passes a pairlist as a SEXP to the compiled code.  This\n      is as was documented, but pairlists were in reality handled\n      differently as a legacy from the early days of R.\n\n    o call_R and call_S are deprecated.  They still exist in the\n      headers and as entry points, but are no longer documented and\n      should not be used for new code.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o str(x, width) now obeys its width argument also for function\n      headers and other objects x where deparse() is applied.\n\n    o The convention for x %/% 0L for integer-mode x has been changed\n      from 0L to NA_integer_.  (PR#14754)\n\n    o The exportMethods directive in a NAMESPACE file now exports S4\n      generics as necessary, as the extensions manual said it does.\n      The manual has also been updated to be a little more informative\n      on this point.\n\n      It is now required that there is an S4 generic (imported or\n      created in the package) when methods are to be exported.\n\n    o Reference methods cannot safely use non-exported entries in the\n      namespace.  We now do not do so, and warn in the documentation.\n\n    o The namespace import code was warning when identical S4 generic\n      functions were imported more than once, but should not (reported\n      by Brian Ripley, then Martin Morgan).\n\n    o merge() is no longer allowed (in some ways) to create a data\n      frame with duplicate column names (which confused PR#14786).\n\n    o Fixes for rendering raster images on X11 and Windows devices when\n      the x-axis or y-axis scale is reversed.\n\n    o getAnywhere() found S3 methods as seen from the utils namespace\n      and not from the environment from which it was called.\n\n    o selectMethod(f, sig) would not return inherited group methods\n      when caching was off (as it is by default).\n\n    o dev.copy2pdf(out.type = &quot;cairo&quot;) gave an error.  (PR#14827)\n\n    o Virtual classes (e.g., class unions) had a NULL prototype even if\n      that was not a legal subclass.  See ?setClassUnion.\n\n    o The C prototypes for zdotc and zdotu in R_ext/BLAS.h have been\n      changed to the more modern style rather than that used by f2c.\n      (Patch by Berwin Turlach.)\n\n    o isGeneric() produced an error for primitives that can not have\n      methods.\n\n    o .C() or .Fortran() had a lack-of-protection error if the\n      registration information resulted in an argument being coerced to\n      another type.\n\n    o boxplot(x=x, at=at) with non finite elements in x and non integer\n      at could not generate a warning but failed.\n\n    o heatmap(x, symm=TRUE, RowSideColors=*) no longer draws the colors\n      in reversed order.\n\n    o predict(&lt;ar&gt;) was incorrect in the multivariate case, for p &gt;= 2.\n\n    o print(x, max=m) is now consistent when x is a &quot;Date&quot;; also the\n      &quot;reached ... max.print ..&quot; messages are now consistently using\n      single brackets.\n\n    o Closed the &lt;li&gt; tag in pages generated by Rd2HTML(). (PR#14841.)\n\n    o Axis tick marks could go out of range when a log scale was used.\n      (PR#14833.)\n\n    o Signature objects in methods were not allocated as S4 objects\n      (caused a problem with trace() reported by Martin Morgan).\n\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard, Professor\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000550.html\">R 2.14.2 is released + R anniversary\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000552.html\">DEADLINE FAST APPROACHING for useR! 2012\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#551\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#551\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#551\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#551\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is intended to be the final round-up release of the 2.14 series; see the list below for details.\n\n(The codename is still not part of the actual sources. That feature will have to wait for 2.15.0, &quot;Easter Beagle&quot;).\n\nThis release also marks the 3rd anniversary of R-1.0.0.\n\nYou can get the source code from\n\n   <A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.14.2.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.14.2.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\nFor the R Core Team\n\nPeter Dalgaard\n\n\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = cbf6da8f886ccd8d0dda0cc7ffd1b8ec\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 748eae477f4c3c8d1f16cc82d9035d18\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 7fc0a51c884e59daae6ea82d7c36af85\nMD5 (NEWS.html) = 2fa78a01a352723ab3cc8e9796fb5c19\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = f5c8657543a293a80d025be58cf1ef71\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = 159efc7bd4ae7b23dda07c1d431657bc\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.14.2.tar.gz) = f5c8657543a293a80d025be58cf1ef71\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file \n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.14.2:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o The internal untar() (as used by default by R CMD INSTALL) now\n      knows about some pax headers which bsdtar (e.g., the default tar\n      for Mac OS &gt;= 10.6) can incorrectly include in tar files, and\n      will skip them with a warning.\n\n    o PCRE has been upgraded to version 8.21: as well as bug fixes and\n      greater Perl compatibility, this adds a JIT pattern compiler,\n      about which PCRE's news says 'large performance benefits can be\n      had in many situations'.  This is supported on most but not all R\n      platforms.\n\n    o Function compactPDF() in package tools now takes the default for\n      argument gs_quality from environment variable GS_QUALITY: there\n      is a new value &quot;none&quot;, the ultimate default, which prevents\n      GhostScript being used in preference to qpdf just because\n      environment variable R_GSCMD is set.  If R_GSCMD is unset or set\n      to &quot;&quot;, the function will try to find a suitable GhostScript\n      executable.\n\n    o The included version of zlib has been updated to 1.2.6.\n\n    o For consistency with the logLik() method, nobs() for &quot;nls&quot; files\n      now excludes observations with zero weight.  (Reported by Berwin\n      Turlach.)\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD check now reports by default on licenses not according to\n      the description in 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o R CMD check has a new option --as-cran to turn on most of the\n      customizations that CRAN uses for its incoming checks.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL will now no longer install certain file types from\n      inst/doc: these are almost certainly mistakes and for some\n      packages are wasting a lot of space.  These are Makefile, files\n      generated by running LaTeX, and unless the package uses a\n      vignettes directory, PostScript and image bitmap files.\n\n      Note that only PDF vignettes have ever been supported: some of\n      these files come from DVI/PS output from the Sweave defaults\n      prior to R 2.13.0.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o R configured with --disable-openmp would mistakenly set\n      HAVE_OPENMP (internal) and SUPPORT_OPENMP (in Rconfig.h) even\n      though no OpenMP flags were populated.\n\n    o The getS3method() implementation had an old computation to find\n      an S4 default method.\n\n    o readLines() could overflow a buffer if the last line of the file\n      was not terminated.  (PR#14766)\n\n    o R CMD check could miss undocumented S4 objects in packages which\n      used S4 classes but did not Depends: methods in their DESCRIPTION\n      file.\n\n    o The HTML Help Search page had malformed links.  (PR#14769)\n\n    o A couple of instances of lack of protection of SEXPs have been\n      squashed. (PR#14772, PR#14773)\n\n    o image(x, useRaster=TRUE) misbehaved on single-column x.\n      (PR#14774)\n\n    o Negative values for options(&quot;max.print&quot;) or the max argument to\n      print.default() caused crashes.  Now the former are ignored and\n      the latter trigger an error.  (PR#14779)\n\n    o The text of a function body containing more than 4096 bytes was\n      not properly saved by the parser when entered at the console.\n\n    o Forgetting the #endif tag in an Rd file could cause the parser to\n      go into a loop.  (Reported by Hans-Jorg Bibiko.)\n\n    o str(*, ....., strict.width=&quot;cut&quot;) now also obeys list.len = n.\n      (Reported by S&quot;oren Vogel.)\n\n    o Printing of arrays did not have enough protection (C level),\n      e.g., in the context of capture.output().  (Reported by Herv'e\n      Pag`es and Martin Morgan.)\n\n    o pdf(file = NULL) would produce a spurious file named NA.\n      (PR#14808)\n\n    o list2env() did not check the type of its envir argument.\n      (PR#14807)\n\n    o svg() could segfault if called with a non-existent file path.\n      (PR#14790)\n\n    o make install can install to a path containing + characters.\n      (PR#14798)\n\n    o The edit() function did not respect the options(&quot;keep.source&quot;)\n      setting. (Reported by Cleridy Lennert.)\n\n    o predict.lm(*, type=&quot;terms&quot;, terms=*, se.fit=TRUE) did not work.\n      (PR#14817)\n\n    o There is a partial workaround for errors in the TRE\n      regular-expressions engine with named classes and repeat counts\n      of at least 2 in a MBCS locale (PR#14408): these are avoided when\n      TRE is in 8-bit mode (e.g. for useBytes = TRUE and when all the\n      data are ASCII).\n\n    o The C function R_ReplDLLdo1() did not call top-level handlers.\n\n    o The Quartz device was unable to detect window sessions on Mac OS\n      X 10.7 (Lion) and higher and thus it was not used as the default\n      device on the console.  Since Lion any application can use window\n      sessions, so Quartz will now be the default device if the user's\n      window session is active and R is not run via ssh which is at\n      least close to the behavior in prior OS X versions.\n\n    o mclapply() would fail in code assembling the translated error\n      message if some (but not all) cores encountered an error.\n\n    o format.POSIXlt(x) raised an arithmetic exception when x was an\n      invalid object of class &quot;POSIXlt&quot; and parts were empty.\n\n    o installed.packages() has some more protection against package\n      installs going on in parallel.\n\n    o .Primitive() could be mis-used to call .Internal() entry points.\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000549.html\">Release plans for 2.14.2 and 2.15.0\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000551.html\">R 2.15.0 is released\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#550\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#550\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#550\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#550\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

Further, two children can call\n      tempfile() simultaneously.\n\n    o Option print in Sweave's RweaveLatex() driver now emulates\n      auto-printing rather than printing (which can differ for an S4\n      object by calling show() rather than print()).\n\n    o filled.contour() now accepts infinite values: previously it might\n      have generated invalid graphics files (e.g. containing NaN\n      values).\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o On 64-bit Linux systems, configure now only sets LIBnn to lib64\n      if /usr/lib64 exists.  This may obviate setting LIBnn explicitly\n      on Debian-derived systems.\n\n      It is still necessary to set LIBnn = lib (or lib32) for 32-bit\n      builds of R on a 64-bit OS on those Linux distributions capable\n      for supporting that concept.\n\n    o configure looks for inconsolata.sty, and if not found adjusts the\n      default R_RD4PDF to not use it (with a warning, since it is\n      needed for high-quality rendering of manuals).\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL will now do a test load for all sub-architectures\n      for which code was compiled (rather than just the primary\n      sub-architecture).\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o When checking examples under more than one sub-architecture, R\n      CMD check now uses a separate directory examples_arch for each\n      sub-architecture, and leaves the output in file\n      pkgname-Ex_arch.Rout.  Some packages expect their examples to be\n      run in a clean directory ....\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o stack() now gives an error if no vector column is selected,\n      rather than returning a 1-column data frame (contrary to its\n      documentation).\n\n    o summary.mlm() did not handle objects where the formula had been\n      specified by an expression.  (Reported by Helios de Rosario\n      Martinez).\n\n    o tools::deparseLatex(dropBraces=TRUE) could drop text as well as\n      braces.\n\n    o colormodel = &quot;grey&quot; (new in R 2.14.0)) did not always work in\n      postscript() and pdf().\n\n    o file.append() could return TRUE for failures.  (PR#14727)\n\n    o gzcon() connections are no longer subject to garbage collection:\n      it was possible for this to happen when unintended (e.g. when\n      calling load()).\n\n    o nobs() does not count zero-weight observations for glm() fits,\n      for consistency with lm().  This affects the BIC() values\n      reported for such glm() fits.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o options(warn = 0) failed to end a (C-level) context with more\n      than 50 accumulated warnings.  (Spotted by Jeffery Horner.)\n\n    o The internal plot.default() code did not do sanity checks on a\n      cex argument, so invalid input could cause problems.  (Reported\n      by Ben Bolker.)\n\n    o anyDuplicated(&lt;array&gt;, MARGIN=0) no longer fails.  (Reported by\n      Herv'e Pag`es.)\n\n    o read.dcf() removes trailing blanks: unfortunately on some\n      platforms this included \\xa0 (non-breaking space) which is the\n      trailing byte of a UTF-8 character.  It now only considers ASCII\n      space and tab to be 'blank'.\n\n    o There was a sign error in part of the calculations for the\n      variance returned by KalmanSmooth().  (PR#14738)\n\n    o pbinom(10, 1e6, 0.01, log.p = TRUE) was NaN thanks to the buggy\n      fix to PR#14320 in R 2.11.0.  (PR#14739)\n\n    o RweaveLatex() now emulates auto-printing rather than printing, by\n      calling methods::show() when auto-printing would.\n\n    o duplicated() ignored fromLast for a one-column data frame.\n      (PR#14742)\n\n    o source() and related functions did not put the correct timestamp\n      on the source references; srcfilecopy() has gained a new argument\n      timestamp to support this fix. (PR#14750)\n\n    o LaTeX conversion of Rd files did not correctly handle\n      preformatted backslashes.  (PR#14751)\n\n    o HTML conversion of Rd files did not handle markup within tabular\n      cells properly.  (PR#14708)\n\n    o source() on an empty file with keep.source = TRUE tried to read\n      from stdin(), in R 2.14.0 only.  (PR#14753)\n\n    o The code to check Rd files in packages would abort if duplicate\n      description sections were present.\n\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000547.html\">The R Journal Vol. 3/2 now published\n</A></li>\n\t\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#548\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#548\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#548\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#548\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This means that any\n      package without a namespace must be re-installed under this\n      version of R (but previously-installed data-only packages without\n      R code can still be used).\n\n    o The yLineBias of the X11() and windows() families of devices has\n      been changed from 0.1 to 0.2: this changes slightly the vertical\n      positioning of text in the margins (including axis annotations).\n      This is mainly for consistency with other devices such as\n      quartz() and pdf().  (Wish of PR#14538.)\n\n      There is a new graphics parameter &quot;ylbias&quot; which allows the\n      y-line bias of the graphics device to be tweaked, including to\n      reproduce output from earlier versions of R.\n\n    o Labeling of the p-values in various anova tables has been\n      rationalized to be either &quot;Pr(&gt;F)&quot; or &quot;Pr(&gt;Chi)&quot; (i.e. the\n      &quot;Pr(F)&quot;, &quot;Pr(Chi)&quot; and &quot;P(&gt;|Chi|)&quot; variants have been\n      eliminated).  Code which extracts the p value _via_ indexing by\n      name may need adjustment.\n\n    o :: can now be used for datasets made available for lazy-loading\n      in packages with namespaces (which makes it consistent with its\n      use for data-only packages without namespaces in earlier versions\n      of R).\n\n    o There is a new package parallel.\n\n      It incorporates (slightly revised) copies of packages multicore\n      and snow (excluding MPI, PVM and NWS clusters).  Code written to\n      use the higher-level API functions in those packages should work\n      unchanged (apart from changing any references to their namespaces\n      to a reference to parallel, and links explicitly to multicore or\n      snow on help pages).\n\n      It also contains support for multiple RNG streams following\n      L'Ecuyer _et al_ (2002), with support for both mclapply and snow\n      clusters.  This replaces functions like clusterSetupRNG() from\n      snow (which are not in parallel).\n\n      The version released for R 2.14.0 contains base functionality:\n      higher-level convenience functions are planned (and some are\n      already available in the 'R-devel' version of R).\n\n    o Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. _via_ R CMD\n      check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata: see the\n      section on 'Making the manuals' in the 'R Installation and\n      Administration Manual'.\n\n    o axTicks(*, log=TRUE) has changed in some cases to satisfy the\n      documented behavior and be consistent.\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o txtProgressBar() can write to an open connection instead of the\n      console.\n\n    o Non-portable package names ending in . are no longer allowed.\n      Nor are single-character package names (R was already\n      disallowed).\n\n    o regexpr() and gregexpr() with perl = TRUE allows Python-style\n      named captures.  (Wish and contribution of PR#14518.)\n\n    o The placement of 'plotmath' text in the margins of plots done by\n      base graphics now makes the same vertical adjustment as ordinary\n      text, so using ordinary and plotmath text on the same margin line\n      will seem better aligned (but not exactly aligned, since ordinary\n      text has descenders below the baseline and plotmath places them\n      on the baseline).  (Related to PR#14537.)\n\n    o sunflowerplot() now has a formula interface.  (Wish of PR#14541.)\n\n    o iconv() has a new argument toRaw to handle encodings such as\n      UTF-16 with embedded nuls (as was possible before the CHARSXP\n      cache was introduced).\n\n      It will also accept as input the type of list generated with\n      toRaw = TRUE.\n\n    o Garbage-collecting an unused input text connection no longer\n      gives a warning (since it 'connects' to nothing outside R).\n\n    o read.table() and scan() have gained a text argument, to allow\n      reading data from a (possibly literal) character string.\n\n    o optim(*, method = .) now allows method = &quot;Brent&quot; as an interface\n      to optimize(), for use in cases such as mle() where optim() is\n      used internally.\n\n    o mosaicplot() gains a border argument.  (Wish of PR#14550.)\n\n    o smooth.spline() gains a tol argument which controls how different\n      x values need to be to be treated as distinct.  The default has\n      been changed to be more reliable for inputs whose range is small\n      compared to their maximum absolute value.  (Wish of PR#14452.)\n\n    o gl() runs faster by avoiding calling factor().\n\n    o The print() method for object.size() accepts B as well as b as an\n      abbreviation for 'bytes'.\n\n    o unlink() gains a force argument to work like rm -f and if\n      possible override restrictive permissions.\n\n    o pbirthday() and qbirthday() now use exact calculations for\n      coincident = 2.\n\n    o unzip() and unz() connections have been updated with support for\n      more recent Zip64 features (including large file sizes and bzip2\n      compression, but not UTF-8 file names).\n\n      unzip() has a new option to restore file times from those\n      recorded (in an unknown timezone) in the zip file.\n\n    o update.packages() now accepts a character vector of package names\n      for the oldPkgs argument.  (Suggestion of Tal Galili.)\n\n    o The special reference class fields .self and .refClassDef are now\n      read-only to prevent corrupting the object.\n\n    o decompose() now returns the original series as part of its value,\n      so it can be used (rather than reconstructed) when plotting.\n      (Suggestion of Rob Hyndman.)\n\n    o Rao's efficient score test has been implemented for glm objects.\n      Specifically, the add1, drop1, and anova methods now allow test =\n      &quot;Rao&quot;.\n\n    o If a saved workspace (e.g. .RData) contains objects that cannot\n      be loaded, R will now start with an warning message and an empty\n      workspace, rather than failing to start.\n\n    o strptime() now accepts times such as 24:00 for midnight at the\n      end of the day, for although these are disallowed by POSIX\n      1003.1-2008, ISO 8601:2004 allows them.\n\n    o Assignment of names() to S4 objects now checks for a\n      corresponding &quot;names&quot; slot, and generates a warning or an error\n      if that slot is not defined.  See the section on slots in\n      ?Classes.\n\n    o The default methods for is.finite(), is.infinite() and is.nan()\n      now signal an error if their argument is not an atomic vector.\n\n    o The formula method for plot() no longer places package stats on\n      the search path (it loads the namespace instead).\n\n    o There now is a genuine &quot;function&quot; method for plot() rather than\n      the generic dispatching internally to graphics::plot.function().\n      It is now exported, so can be called directly as plot.function().\n\n    o The one-sided ks.test() allows exact = TRUE to be specified in\n      the presence of ties (but the approximate calculation remains the\n      default: the 'exact' computation makes assumptions known to be\n      invalid in the presence of ties).\n\n    o The behaviour of curve(add = FALSE) has changed: it now no longer\n      takes the default x limits from the previous plot (if any):\n      rather they default to c(0, 1) just as the &quot;function&quot; method for\n      plot().  To get the previous behaviour use curve(add = NA), which\n      also takes the default for log-scaling of the x-axis from the\n      previous plot.\n\n    o Both curve() and the plot() method for functions have a new\n      argument xname to facilitate plots such as sin(t) _vs_ t.\n\n    o The local argument to source() can specify an environment as well\n      as TRUE (parent.env()) and FALSE (.GlobalEnv).  It gives better\n      error messages for other values, such as NA.\n\n    o vcov() gains methods for classes &quot;summary.lm&quot; and &quot;summary.glm&quot;.\n\n    o The plot() method for class &quot;profile.nls&quot; gains ylab and lty\n      arguments, and passes ... on to plot.default.\n\n    o Character-string arguments such as the mode argument of vector(),\n      as.vector() and is.vector() and the description argument of\n      file() are required to be of length exactly one, rather than any\n      further elements being silently discarded.  This helps catch\n      incorrect usage in programming.\n\n    o The length argument of vector() and its wrappers such as\n      numeric() is required to be of length exactly one (other values\n      are now an error rather than giving a warning as previously).\n\n    o vector(len) and length(x) &lt;- len no longer acccept TRUE/FALSE for\n      len (not that they were ever documented to, but there was\n      special-casing in the C code).\n\n    o There is a new function Sys.setFileTime() to set the time of a\n      file (including a directory).  See its help for exactly which\n      times it sets on various OSes.\n\n    o The file times reported by file.info() are reported to sub-second\n      resolution on systems which support it.  (Currently the POSIX\n      2008 and FreeBSD/Darwin/NetBSD methods are detected.)\n\n    o New function getCall(m) as an abstraction for m$call, enabling\n      update()'s default method to apply more universally.  (NB: this\n      can be masked by existing functions in packages.)\n\n    o Sys.info() gains a euser component to report the 'effective' user\n      on OSes which have that concept.\n\n    o The result returned by try() now contains the original error\n      condition object as the &quot;condition&quot; attribute.\n\n    o All packages with R code are lazy-loaded irrespective of the\n      LazyLoad field in the DESCRIPTION file.  A warning is given if\n      the LazyLoad field is overridden.\n\n    o Rd markup has a new \\figure tag so that figures can be included\n      in help pages when converted to HTML or LaTeX.  There are\n      examples on the help pages for par() and points().\n\n    o The built-in httpd server now allows access to files in the\n      session temporary directory tempdir(), addressed as the /session\n      directory on the httpd server.\n\n    o Development versions of R are no longer referred to by the number\n      under which they might be released, e.g. in the startup banner, R\n      --version and sessionUtils().  The correct way to refer to a\n      development version of R is 'R-devel', preferably with the date\n      and SVN version number.\n      E.g. R-devel (2011-07-04 r56266)\n\n    o There is a new function texi2pdf() in package tools, currently a\n      convenience wrapper for texi2dvi(pdf = TRUE).\n\n    o There are two new options for typesetting PDF manuals from Rd\n      files.  These are beramono and inconsolata, and used the named\n      font for monospaced output. They are intended to be used in\n      combination with times, and times,inconsolata,hyper is now the\n      default for the reference manual and package manuals.  If you do\n      not have that font installed, you can set R_RD4PF to one of the\n      other options: see the 'R Installation and Administration\n      Manual'.\n\n    o Automatic printing for reference classes is now done by the\n      $show() method.  A method is defined for class envRefClass and\n      may be overriden for user classes (see the ?ReferenceClasses\n      example).  S4 show() methods should no longer be needed for\n      reference classes.\n\n    o tools::Rdiff (by default) and R CMD Rdiff now ignore differences\n      in pointer values when comparing printed environments, compiled\n      byte code, etc.\n\n    o The &quot;source&quot; attribute on functions created with keep.source=TRUE\n      has been replaced with a &quot;srcref&quot; attribute.  The &quot;srcref&quot;\n      attribute references an in-memory copy of the source file using\n      the &quot;srcfilecopy&quot; class or the new &quot;srcfilealias&quot; class.\n\n    o New items User Manuals and Technical Papers have been added to\n      the HTML help main page.  These link to vignettes in the base and\n      recommended packages and to a collection of papers about R\n      issues, respectively.\n\n    o Documentation and messages have been standardized to use\n      &quot;namespace&quot; rather than &quot;name space&quot;.\n\n    o setGeneric() now looks in the default packages for a non-generic\n      version of a function if called from a package with a namespace.\n      (It always did for packages without a namespace.)\n\n    o Setting the environment variable _R_WARN_ON_LOCKED_BINDINGS_ will\n      give a warning if an attempt is made to change a locked binding.\n\n    o \\SweaveInput is now supported when generating concordances in\n      Sweave().\n\n    o findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() now allow the environment to be\n      specified indirectly; the latter gains a clear argument to allow\n      it to call untrace().\n\n    o The body of a closure can be one of further types of R objects,\n      including enviroments and external pointers.\n\n    o The Rd2HTML() function in package tools now has a stylesheet\n      argument, allowing pages to be displayed in alternate formats.\n\n    o New function requireNamespace() analogous to require(), returning\n      a logical value after attempting to load a namespace.\n\n    o There is a new type of RNG, &quot;L'Ecuyer-CMRG&quot;, implementing\n      L'Ecuyer (1999)'s 'combined multiple-recursive generator'\n      MRG32k3a.  See the comments on ?RNG.\n\n    o help.search() and ?? can now display vignettes and demos as well\n      as help pages.  The new option &quot;help.search.types&quot; controls the\n      types of documentation and the order of their display.\n\n      This also applies to HTML searches, which now give results in all\n      of help pages, vignettes and demos.\n\n    o socketConnection() now has a timeout argument.  It is now\n      documented that large values (package snow used a year) do not\n      work on some OSes.\n\n    o The initialization of the random-number generator now uses the\n      process ID as well as the current time, just in case two R\n      processes are launched very rapidly on a machine with\n      low-resolution wall clock (some have a resolution of a second;\n      modern systems have microsecond-level resolution).\n\n    o New function pskill() in the tools package to send a terminate\n      signal to one or more processes, plus constants such as SIGTERM\n      to provide a portable way to refer to signals (since the numeric\n      values are OS-dependent).\n\n    o New function psnice() in the tools package to return or change\n      the 'niceness' of a process.  (Refers to the 'priority class' on\n      Windows.)\n\n    o list.dirs() gains a recursive argument.\n\n    o An <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">Authors at R</A> field in a package DESCRIPTION file can now be used\n      to generate Author and Maintainer fields if needed, and to\n      auto-generate package citations.\n\n    o New utility getElement() for accessing either a list component or\n      a slot in an S4 object.\n\n    o stars() gains a col.lines argument, thanks to Dustin Sallings.\n      (Wish of PR#14657.)\n\n    o New function regmatches() for extracting or replacing matched or\n      non-matched substrings from match data obtained by regexpr(),\n      gregexpr() and regexec().\n\n    o help(package = &quot;pkg_name&quot;, help_type = &quot;HTML&quot;) now gives HTML\n      help on the package rather than text help.  (This gives direct\n      access to the HTML version of the package manual shown _via_\n      help.start()'s 'Packages' menu.)\n\n    o agrep() gains a fixed argument to optionally allow approximate\n      regular expression matching, and a costs argument to specify\n      possibly different integer match costs for insertions, deletions\n      and substitutions.\n\n    o read.dcf() and write.dcf() gain a keep.white argument to indicate\n      fields where whitespace should be kept as is.\n\n    o available.packages() now works around servers that fail to return\n      an error code when PACKAGES.gz does not exist.  (Patch submitted\n      by Seth Schommer.)\n\n    o readBin() can now read more than 2^31 - 1 bytes in a single call\n      (the previously documented limitation).\n\n    o New function regexec() for finding the positions of matches as\n      well as all substrings corresponding to parenthesized\n      subexpressions of the given regular expression.\n\n    o New function adist() in package utils for computing 'edit'\n      (generalized Levenshtein) distances between strings.\n\n    o Class &quot;raster&quot; gains an is.na method to avoid confusion from the\n      misuse of the matrix method (such as PR#14618).\n\n    o The identical() function gains an ignore.bytecode argument to\n      control comparison of compiled functions.\n\n    o pmin and pmax now warn if an argument is partially recycled (wish\n      of PR#14638).\n\n    o The default for image(useRaster=) is now taken from option\n      &quot;preferRaster&quot;: for the small print see ?image.\n\n    o str() now displays reference class objects and their fields,\n      rather than treating them as classical S4 classes.\n\n    o New function aregexec() in package utils for finding the\n      positions of approximate string matches as well as all substrings\n      corresponding to parenthesized subexpressions of the given\n      regular expression.\n\n    o download.file() has an extra argument to pass additional\n      command-line options to the non-default methods using\n      command-line utilities.\n\n      cacheOK = FALSE is now supported for method = &quot;curl&quot;.\n\n    o interaction.plot(*, type = .) now also allows type &quot;o&quot; or &quot;c&quot;.\n\n    o axTicks(*, log=TRUE) did sometimes give more values than the\n      ticks in the corresponding graphics::axis().  By default, it now\n      makes use of the new (graphics-package independent) axisTicks()\n      which can make use of a new utility .axisPars().  Further, it now\n      returns a decreasing sequence (as for log=FALSE) when usr is\n      decreasing.\n\n    o Using fix() or edit() on a R object (except perhaps a matrix or\n      data frame) writes its temporary file with extension .R so\n      editors which select their mode based on the extension will\n      select a suitable mode.\n\n  GRAPHICS DEVICES:\n\n    o The pdf() device makes use of Flate compression: this is\n      controlled by the new logical argument compress, and is enabled\n      by default.\n\n    o Devices svg(), cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() gain a family argument.\n\n      On a Unix-alike X11() gains a family argument.  This is one of\n      the x11.options() and so can be passed as an argument to the\n      bmp(), jpeg(), png() and tiff() devices.\n\n      Analogous changes have been made on Windows, so all built-in R\n      graphics devices now have a family argument except pictex()\n      (which has no means to change fonts).\n\n    o The bmp(), jpeg(), png() and tiff() devices now make use of the\n      antialias argument for type = &quot;quartz&quot;.\n\n    o There are several new built-in font mappings for X11(type =\n      &quot;Xlib&quot;): see the help on X11Fonts().\n\n    o There is a new type X11(type = &quot;dbcairo&quot;) which updates the\n      screeen less frequently: see its help page.\n\n    o The X11() device now makes use of cursors to distinguish its\n      states.  The normal cursor is an arrow (rather than a crosshair);\n      the crosshair is used when the locator is in use, and a watch\n      cursor is shown when plotting computations are being done.\n      (These are the standard names for X11 cursors: how they are\n      actually displayed depends on the window manager.)\n\n    o New functions dev.hold() and dev.flush() for use with graphics\n      devices with buffering.  These are used for most of the\n      high-level graphics functions such as boxplot(), so that the plot\n      is only displayed when the page is complete.\n\n      Currently implemented for windows(buffered = TRUE), quartz() and\n      the cairographics-based X11() types with buffering (which are the\n      default on-screen devices).\n\n    o New function dev.capture() for capture of bitmap snapshots of\n      image-based devices (a superset of the functionality provided by\n      grid.cap() in grid).\n\n    o The default colormodel for pdf() and postscript() is now called\n      &quot;srgb&quot; to more accurately describe it.  (Instead of &quot;rgb&quot;, and in\n      the case of postscript() it no longer switches to and from the\n      gray colorspace, by default.)\n\n      The colormodel for postscript() which does use both gray and sRGB\n      colorspaces is now called &quot;srgb+gray&quot;.\n\n      Plots which are known to use only black/white/transparent can\n      advantageously use colormodel = &quot;gray&quot; (just as before, but there\n      is now slightly more advantage in doing so).\n\n    o postscript() with values colormodel = &quot;rgb&quot; and colormodel =\n      &quot;rgb-nogray&quot; give the behaviour prior to R 2.13.0 of uncalibrated\n      RGB, which under some circumstances can be rendered much faster\n      by a viewer.\n\n      pdf(colormodel = &quot;rgb&quot;) gives the behaviour prior to R 2.13.0 of\n      uncalibrated RGB, which under some circumstances can be rendered\n      faster by a viewer, and the files will be smaller (by about 9KB\n      if compression is not used).\n\n    o The postscript() device only includes the definition of the sRGB\n      colorspace in the output file for the colormodels which use it.\n\n    o The postscript() and pdf() devices now output greyscale raster\n      images (and not RGB) when colormodel = &quot;gray&quot;.\n\n    o postscript(colormodel = &quot;gray&quot;) now accepts non-grey colours and\n      uses their luminance (as pdf() long has).\n\n    o colormodel = &quot;grey&quot; is allowed as an alternative name for\n      postscript() and pdf().\n\n    o pdf() in the default sRGB colorspace outputs many fewer changes\n      of colorspace, which may speed up rendering in some viewing\n      applications.\n\n    o There is a new function dev.capabilities() to query the\n      capabilities of the current device.  The initial set of\n      capabilities are support for semi-transparent colours, rendering\n      and capturing raster images, the locator and for interactive\n      events.\n\n    o For pdf(), maxRasters is increased as needed so the argument is\n      no longer used.\n\n  SWEAVE &amp; VIGNETTES:\n\n    o Options keep.source = TRUE, figs.only = FALSE are now the\n      default.\n\n    o The way the type of user-defined options is determined has\n      changed.  Previously they were all regarded as logical: now the\n      type is determined by the value given at first use.\n\n    o The allowed values of logical options are now precisely those\n      allowed for character inputs to as.logical(): this means that t\n      and f are no longer allowed (although T and F still are).\n\n    o The preferred location for vignette sources is now the directory\n      vignettes and not inst/doc: R CMD build will now re-build\n      vignettes in directory vignettes and copy the .Rnw (etc) files\n      and the corresponding PDFs to inst/doc.  Further files to be\n      copied to inst/doc can be specified _via_ the file\n      vignettes/.install_extras.\n\n    o R CMD Sweave now supports a --driver option to select the Sweave\n      driver: the default is equivalent to --driver=RweaveLatex.\n\n    o R CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle support options --encoding and\n      --options.\n\n    o The Rtangle() driver allows output = &quot;stdout&quot; or output =\n      &quot;stderr&quot; to select the output or message connection.  This is\n      convenient for scripting using something like\n\n          R CMD Stangle --options='output=&quot;stdout&quot;' foo.Rnw &gt; foo2.R\n\n    o There is a new option pdf.compress controlling whether PDF\n      figures are generated using Flate compression (they are by\n      default).\n\n    o R CMD Sweave now has a --pdf option to produce a PDF version of\n      the processed Sweave document.\n\n    o It is no longer allowed to have two vignettes with the same\n      vignette basename (e.g. vig.Rnw and vig.Snw).  (Previously one\n      vignette hid the other in the vignette() function.)\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    o Function R_tmpnam2 has been added to the API to allow a temporary\n      filename to include a specified extension.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o Package DESCRIPTION file field KeepSource forces the package to\n      be installed with keep.source = TRUE (or FALSE).  (Suggestion of\n      Greg Snow.  Note that as all packages are lazy-loaded, this is\n      now only relevant at installation.)\n\n      There are corresponding options --with-keep.source and\n      --without-keep.source for R CMD INSTALL.\n\n    o R CMD INSTALL has a new option --byte-compile to byte-compile the\n      packages during installation (since all packages are now\n      lazy-loaded).  This can be controlled on a per-package basis by\n      the optional field ByteCompile in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o A package R code but without a NAMESPACE file will have a default\n      one created at R CMD build or R CMD INSTALL time, so all packages\n      will be installed with namespaces.  A consequence of this is that\n      .First.lib() functions need to be copied to .onLoad() (usually)\n      or .onAttach().  For the time being, if there is an\n      auto-generated NAMESPACE file and no .onLoad() nor .onAttach()\n      function is found but .First.lib() is, it will be run as the\n      attach hook (unless the package is one of a list of known\n      exceptions, when it will be run as the load hook).\n\n    o A warning is given if test-loading a package changes a locked\n      binding in a package other than itself.  It is likely that this\n      will be disallowed in future releases.  (There are _pro tem_ some\n      exceptions to the warning.)\n\n    o A dependency on SVN revision is allowed for R, e.g. R (&gt;=\n      r56550).  This should be used in conjunction with a version\n      number, e.g. R (&gt;= 2.14.0), R (&gt;= r56550) to distinguish beteen\n      R-patched and R-devel versions with the same SVN revision.\n\n    o installed.packages() now hashes the names of its cache files to\n      avoid very rare problems with excessively long path names.\n      (PR#14669)\n\n    o A top-level COPYING file in a package is no longer installed\n      (file names LICENSE or LICENCE having long been preferred).\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    o R CMD check now gives an error if the R code in a vignette fails\n      to run, unless this is caused by a missing package.\n\n    o R CMD check now unpacks tarballs in the same way as R CMD\n      INSTALL, including making use of the environment variable\n      R_INSTALL_TAR to override the default behaviour.\n\n    o R CMD check performs additional code analysis of package startup\n      functions, and notifies about incorrect argument lists and\n      (incorrect) calls to functions which modify the search path or\n      inappropriately generate messages.\n\n    o R CMD check now also checks compiled code for symbols\n      corresponding to functions which might terminate R or write to\n      stdout/stderr instead of the console.\n\n    o R CMD check now uses a pdf() device when checking examples\n      (rather than postscript()).\n\n    o R CMD check now checks line-endings of makefiles and\n      C/C++/Fortran sources in subdirectories of src as well as in src\n      itself.\n\n    o R CMD check now reports as a NOTE what look like methods\n      documented with their full names even if there is a namespace and\n      they are exported.  In almost all cases they are intended to be\n      used only as methods and should use the \\method markup.  In the\n      other rare cases the recommended form is to use a function such\n      as coefHclust which would not get confused with a method,\n      document that and register it in the NAMESPACE file by\n      s3method(coef, hclust, coefHclust).\n\n    o The default for the environment variable _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_\n      is now true: thus if using the newer forms of compression\n      introduced in R 2.10.0 would be beneficial is now checked (by\n      default).\n\n    o Reference output for a vignette can be supplied when checking a\n      package by R CMD check: see 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o R CMD Rd2dvi allows the use of LaTeX package inputenx rather than\n      inputenc: the value of the environment variable RD2DVI_INPUTENC\n      is used.  (LaTeX package inputenx is an optional install which\n      provides greater coverage of the UTF-8 encoding.)\n\n    o Rscript on a Unix-alike now accepts file names containing spaces\n      (provided these are escaped or quoted in the shell).\n\n    o R CMD build on a Unix-alike (only) now tries to preserve dates on\n      files it copies from its input directory.  (This was the\n      undocumented behaviour prior to R 2.13.0.)\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    o require() no longer has a save argument.\n\n    o The gamma argument to hsv(), rainbow(), and rgb2hsv() has been\n      removed.\n\n    o The --no-docs option for R CMD build --binary is defunct: use\n      --install-args instead.\n\n    o The option --unsafe to R CMD INSTALL is defunct: use the\n      identical option --no-lock instead.\n\n    o The entry point pythag formerly in Rmath.h is defunct: use\n      instead the C99 function hypot.\n\n    o R CMD build --binary is formally defunct: R CMD INSTALL --build\n      has long been the preferred alternative.\n\n    o zip.file.extract() is now defunct: use unzip() or unz() instead.\n\n    o R CMD Rd2dvi without the --pdf option is now deprecated: only PDF\n      output will be supported in future releases (since this allows\n      the use of fonts only supported for PDF), and only R CMD Rd2pdf\n      will be available.\n\n    o Options such as --max-nsize and the function mem.limits() are now\n      deprecated: these limits are nowadays almost never used, and are\n      reported by gc() when they are in use.\n\n    o Forms like binomial(link = &quot;link&quot;) for GLM families deprecated\n      since R 2.4.0 are now defunct.\n\n    o The declarativeOnly argument to loadNamespace() (not relevant\n      since R 2.13.0) has been removed.\n\n    o Use of library.dynam() without specifying all the first three\n      arguments is deprecated.  (It is often called from a namespace,\n      and the defaults are only appropriate to a package.)\n\n      Use of chname in library.dynam() with the extension .so or .dll\n      (which is clearly not allowed according to the help page) is\n      deprecated.  This also applies to library.dynam.unload() and\n      useDynLib directives in NAMESPACE files.\n\n    o It is deprecated to use mean(x) and sd(x) directly on data frames\n      (or also matrices, for sd) x, instead of simply using sapply.\n\n      In the same spirit, median(x) now gives an error for a data frame\n      x (it often gave nonsensical results).\n\n    o The keep.source argument to library() and require() is\n      deprecated: it was only used for packages installed without\n      lazy-loading, and now all packages are lazy-loaded.\n\n    o Using a false value for the DESCRIPTION field LazyLoad is\n      deprecated.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o The base and recommended packages are now byte-compiled\n      (equivalent to make bytecode in R 2.13.x).\n\n    o Configure option --with-system-zlib now only makes use of the\n      basic interface of zlib and not the C function gzseek which has\n      shown erroneous behaviour in zlib 1.2.4 and 1.2.5.\n\n    o The zlib in the R sources is now version 1.2.5.  (This is safe\n      even on 32-bit Linux systems because only the basic interface is\n      now used.)\n\n    o The .afm files in package grDevices are now installed as\n      compressed files (as long done on Windows), saving ca 2MB on the\n      installed size.\n\n    o The non-screen cairo-based devices are no longer in the X11\n      module and so can be installed without X11.  (We have never seen\n      a Unix-alike system with cairographics installed but not X11, but\n      a user might select --without-x.)\n\n    o Configure will try to use -fobjc-exceptions for the Objective-C\n      compiler (if present) to ensure that even compilers that do not\n      enable exceptions by default (such as vanilla gcc) can be used.\n      (Objective-C is currently only used on Mac OS X.)\n\n    o The system call times is required.\n\n    o The C99 functions acosh, asinh, atanh, snprintf and vsnprintf are\n      now required.\n\n    o There is no longer support for making DVI manuals _via_ make dvi,\n      make install-dvi and similar.  Only PDF manuals are supported (to\n      allow the use of fonts which are only available for PDF.)\n\n    o The configure arguments used during configuration of R are\n      included as a comment in Makeconf for informative purposes on\n      Unix-alikes in a form suitable for shell execution.  Note that\n      those are merely command-line arguments, they do not include\n      environment variables (one more reason to use configure variables\n      instead) or site configuration settings.\n\n    o Framework installation now supports DESTDIR (Mac OS X only).\n\n    o Java detection (R CMD javareconf) works around bogus\n      java.library.path property in recent Oracle Java binaries.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o The locale category LC_MONETARY was only being set on startup on\n      Windows: that is now done on Unix-alikes where supported.\n\n    o Reference class utilities will detect an attempt to modify\n      methods or fields in a locked class definition (e.g., in a\n      namespace) and generate an error.\n\n    o The formula methods for lines(), points() and text() now work\n      even if package stats is not on the search path.\n\n    o In principle, S4 classes from different packages could have the\n      same name.  This has not previously worked.  Changes have now\n      been installed that should allow such classes and permit methods\n      to use them.  New functions className() and multipleClasses() are\n      related tools for programming.\n\n    o Work around an issue in Linux (a system select call resetting tv)\n      which prevented internet operations from timing out properly.\n\n    o Several stack trampling and overflow issues have been fixed in\n      TRE, triggered by agrep and friends with long patterns.\n      (PR#14627.)\n\n    o (&quot;design infelicity&quot;) Field assignments in reference classes are\n      now consistent with slots in S4 classes: the assigned value must\n      come from the declared class (if any) for the field or from a\n      subclass.\n\n    o The methods objects constructed for &quot;coerce&quot; and &quot;coerce&lt;-&quot; were\n      lacking some essential information in the generic, defined and\n      target slots; as() did not handle duplicate class definitions\n      correctly.\n\n    o The parser no longer accepts the digit 8 in an octal character\n      code in a string, nor does it accept unterminated strings in a\n      file.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o The print() method for class &quot;summary.aov&quot; did not pass on\n      argument digits when summary() was called on a single object, and\n      hence used more digits than documented.\n\n    o The X11() device's cairo back-end produced incorrect capture\n      snapshot images on big-endian machines.\n\n    o loglin() gave a spurious error when argument margin consisted of\n      a single element of length one.  (PR#14690)\n\n    o loess() is better protected against misuse, e.g. zero-length\n      span.  (PR#14691)\n\n    o HoltWinters() checks that the optimization succeeded. (PR#14694)\n\n    o The (undocumented) inclusion of superclass objects in default\n      initializing of reference classes overwrote explicit field\n      arguments. The bug is fixed, the feature documented and a test\n      added.\n\n    o round(x, -Inf) now does something sensible (return zero rather\n      than NA).\n\n    o signif(x, -Inf) now behaves as documented (signif(x, 1)) rather\n      than giving zero.\n\n    o The &quot;table&quot; method for Axis() hardcoded side = 1, hence calls to\n      plot(&lt;vector&gt;, &lt;table&gt;) labelled the wrong axis. (PR#14699)\n\n    o Creating a connection might fail under gctorture(TRUE).\n\n    o stack() and unstack() converted character columns to factors.\n\n      unstack() sometimes produced incorrect results (a list or a\n      vector) if the factor on which to un-split had only one level.\n\n    o On some systems help(&quot;.C&quot;, help_type = &quot;pdf&quot;) and similar\n      generated file names that TeX was unable to handle.\n\n    o Non-blocking listening socket connections continued to report\n      isIncomplete() as true even when the peer had closed down and all\n      available input had been read.\n\n    o The revised HTML search system now generates better hyperlinks to\n      help topics found: previously it gave problems with help pages\n      with names containing e.g. spaces and slashes.\n\n    o A late change in R 2.13.2 broke \\Sexpr expressions in Rd files.\n\n    o The creation of ticks on log axes (including axTicks() sometimes\n      incorrectly omitted a tick at one end\n\n    o The creation of ticks on log axes (including by axTicks())\n      sometimes incorrectly omitted a tick at one end of the range by\n      rounding error in a platform-dependent way.  This could be seen\n      in the examples for axTicks(), where with axis limits c(0.2, 88)\n      the tick for 0.2 was sometimes omitted.\n\n    o qgamma() for small shape underflows to 0 rather than sometimes\n      giving NaN.  (PR#8528, PR#14710)\n\n    o mapply() now gives an explicit error message (rather than an\n      obscure one) is inputs of zero and positive length are mixed.\n\n    o Setting a Hershey font family followed by string height query\n      would crash R.\n\n    o R CMD javareconf -e would fail for some shells due to a shift\n      error. Also the resulting paths will no longer contain\n      $(JAVA_HOME) as that can result in an unintended substitution\n      based on Makeconf instead of the shell setting.\n\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000543.html\">R 2.13.2 is released\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000545.html\">Windows binary of 2.14.0\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#544\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#544\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#544\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#544\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is intended to be the final release of the 2.13 series, for the benefit of those apprehensive of putting 2.14.x into production use. \n\nThe run-in for 2.14.0 starts on Monday, with a planned release on Oct 31 (The Great Pumpkin Man Release).\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.13.2.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.13.2.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n   For the R Core Team\n\n   Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = cbf6da8f886ccd8d0dda0cc7ffd1b8ec\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 9313f40d1614e33bb2872dcdf09bdf1b\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = af38550b8f19f81357158effdbc44fc3\nMD5 (NEWS.html) = 2c0741963f34888f5095225217e51666\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = fbad74f6415385f86425d0f3968dd684\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = 159efc7bd4ae7b23dda07c1d431657bc\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.13.2.tar.gz) = fbad74f6415385f86425d0f3968dd684\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.2:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    o mem.limits() now reports values larger than the maximum integer\n      (previously documented to be reported as NA), and allows larger\n      values to be set, including Inf to remove the limit.\n\n    o The print() methods for classes &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;POSIXct&quot; and &quot;POSIXlt&quot;\n      respect the option &quot;max.print&quot; and so are much faster for very\n      long datetime vectors.  (Suggestion of Yohan Chalabi.)\n\n    o untar2() now works around errors generated with tar files that\n      use more than the standard 6 digits for the checksum.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14654PR#14654\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14654PR#14654</A>)\n\n    o install.packages() with Ncpus &gt; 1 guards against simultaneous\n      installation of indirect dependencies as well as direct ones.\n\n    o Sweave now knows about a few more Windows' encodings (including\n      cp1250 and cp1257) and some inputenx encodings such as koi8-r.\n\n    o postscript(colormodel = &quot;rgb-nogray&quot;) no longer sets the sRGB\n      colorspace for each colour and so some viewers may render its\n      files much faster than the default colormodel =&quot;rgb&quot;.\n\n    o The default for pdf(maxRasters=) has been increased from 64 to\n      1000.\n\n    o readBin() now warns if signed = FALSE is used inappropriately\n      (rather than being silently ignored).\n\n      It enforces the documented limit of 2^31-1 bytes in a single\n      call.\n\n    o PCRE has been updated to version 8.13, a bug-fix release with\n      updated Unicode tables (version 6.0.0). An additional patch (r611\n      from PCRE 8.20-to-be) has been added to fix a collation symbol\n      recognition issue.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    o It is possible to build in src/extra/xdr on more platforms.\n      (Needed since glibc 2.14 hides its RPC implementation.)\n\n    o configure will find the Sun TI-RPC implementation of xdr (in\n      libtirpc) provided its header files are in the search path: see\n      the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    o Using a broad exportPattern directive in a NAMESPACE file is no\n      longer allowed to export internal objects such as .onLoad and\n      .__S3MethodsTable__. .\n\n      These are also excluded from imports, along with .First.lib.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    o fisher.test() had a buglet: If arguments were factors with unused\n      levels, levels were dropped and you would get an error saying\n      that there should be at least two levels, inconsistently with\n      pre-tabulated data.  (Reported by Michael Fay).\n\n    o package.skeleton() will no longer dump S4 objects supplied\n      directly rather than in a code file.  These cannot be restored\n      correctly from the dumped version.\n\n    o Build-time expressions in help files did not have access to\n      functions in the package being built (with R CMD build).\n\n    o Because quote() did not mark its result as being in use,\n      modification of the result could in some circumstances modify the\n      original call.\n\n    o Plotting pch = '.' now guarantees at least a one-pixel dot if cex\n      &gt; 0.\n\n    o The very-rarely-used command-line option --max-vsize was\n      incorrectly interpreted as a number of Vcells and not in bytes as\n      documented.  (Spotted by Christophe Rhodes.)\n\n    o The HTML generated by Rd2HTML() comes closer to being standards\n      compliant.\n\n    o filter(x, recursive = TRUE) gave incorrect results on a series\n      containing NAs.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o Profiling stats::mle() fits with a fixed parameter was not\n      supported.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14646PR#14646\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14646PR#14646</A>)\n\n    o retracemem() was still using positional matching.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14650PR#14650\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14650PR#14650</A>)\n\n    o The quantile method for &quot;ecdf&quot; objects now works and is\n      documented.\n\n    o xtabs(~ .., ..., sparse=TRUE) now also works together with an\n      exclude = .. specification.\n\n    o decompose() computed an incorrect seasonal component for time\n      series with odd frequencies.\n\n    o The pdf() device only includes the definition of the sRGB\n      colorspace in the output file for the &quot;rgb&quot; colormodel (and not\n      for &quot;gray&quot; nor &quot;cmyk&quot;): this saves ca 9KB in the output file.\n\n    o .hasSlot() wrongly gave FALSE in some cases.\n\n    o Sweave() with keep.source=TRUE could generate spurious NA lines\n      when a chunk reference appeared last in a code chunk.\n\n    o \\Sexpr[results=rd] in an .Rd file now first tries\n      parse_Rd(fragment=FALSE) to allow Rd section-level macros to be\n      inserted.\n\n    o The print() method for class &quot;summary.aov&quot; did not pass on\n      arguments such as signif.stars when summary() was called on a\n      single object.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14684PR#14684\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14684PR#14684</A>)\n\n    o In rare cases ks.test() could return a p-value very slightly less\n      than 0 by rounding error.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14671PR#14671\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14671PR#14671</A>)\n\n    o If trunc() was called on a &quot;POSIXlt&quot; vector and the result was\n      subsetted, all but the first element was converted to NA.\n      (<A HREF=\"https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14679PR#14679\">https://bugs.R-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14679PR#14679</A>)\n\n    o cbind() and rbind() could cause memory corruption when used on a\n      combination of raw and logical/integer vectors.\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000542.html\">[R] R 2.14.0 scheduled for October 31, 2.13.2 for September 30\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000544.html\">R 2.14.0 is released\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#543\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#543\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#543\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#543\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is a maintenance release to consolidate various minor fixes to 2.13.0. \n\nThe Licencing change to GPL-2 | GPL-3 may be of interest to some.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.13.1.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.13.1.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n    For the R Core Team\n\n    Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = ac9746b4845ae866661f51cfc99262f5\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = a6f58169fec241d4fa4ab283d8cb12de\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 8347135398220ba817bbf1c97586ec53\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = 28dd0d68ac3a0eab93fe7035565a1c30\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = 03d783ff71270c77d497fd573d711fd8\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.13.1.tar.gz) = 28dd0d68ac3a0eab93fe7035565a1c30\n\n\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\nR News\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.13.1:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    &#8226; iconv() no longer translates NA strings as &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; persp(box = TRUE) now warns if the surface extends outside the\n      box (since occlusion for the box and axes is computed assuming\n      the box is a bounding box). (PR#202.)\n\n    &#8226; RShowDoc() can now display the licences shipped with R, e.g.\n      RShowDoc(&quot;GPL-3&quot;).\n\n    &#8226; New wrapper function showNonASCIIfile() in package tools.\n\n    &#8226; nobs() now has a &quot;mle&quot; method in package stats4.\n\n    &#8226; trace() now deals correctly with S4 reference classes and\n      corresponding reference methods (e.g., $trace()) have been added.\n\n    &#8226; xz has been updated to 5.0.3 (very minor bugfix release).\n\n    &#8226; tools::compactPDF() gets more compression (usually a little,\n      sometimes a lot) by using the compressed object streams of PDF\n      1.5.\n\n    &#8226; cairo_ps(onefile = TRUE) generates encapsulated EPS on platforms\n      with cairo &gt;= 1.6.\n\n    &#8226; Binary reads (e.g. by readChar() and readBin()) are now supported\n      on clipboard connections.  (Wish of PR#14593.)\n\n    &#8226; as.POSIXlt.factor() now passes ... to the character method\n      (suggestion of Joshua Ulrich).  [Intended for R 2.13.0 but\n      accidentally removed before release.]\n\n    &#8226; vector() and its wrappers such as integer() and double() now warn\n      if called with a length argument of more than one element.  This\n      helps track down user errors such as calling double(x) instead of\n      as.double(x).\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; Building the vignette PDFs in packages grid and utils is now part\n      of running make from an SVN checkout on a Unix-alike: a separate\n      make vignettes step is no longer required.\n\n      These vignettes are now made with keep.source = TRUE and hence\n      will be laid out differently.\n\n    &#8226; make install-strip failed under some configuration options.\n\n    &#8226; Packages can customize non-standard installation of compiled code\n      via a src/install.libs.R script. This allows packages that have\n      architecture-specific binaries (beyond the package's shared\n      objects/DLLs) to be installed in a multi-architecture setting.\n\n  SWEAVE &amp; VIGNETTES:\n\n    &#8226; Sweave() and Stangle() gain an encoding argument to specify the\n      encoding of the vignette sources if the latter do not contain a\n      \\usepackage[]{inputenc} statement specifying a single input\n      encoding.\n\n    &#8226; There is a new Sweave option figs.only = TRUE to run each figure\n      chunk only for each selected graphics device, and not first using\n      the default graphics device.  This will become the default in R\n      2.14.0.\n\n    &#8226; Sweave custom graphics devices can have a custom function\n      foo.off() to shut them down.\n\n    &#8226; Warnings are issued when non-portable filenames are found for\n      graphics files (and chunks if split = TRUE).  Portable names are\n      regarded as alphanumeric plus hyphen, underscore, plus and hash\n      (periods cause problems with recognizing file extensions).\n\n    &#8226; The Rtangle() driver has a new option show.line.nos which is by\n      default false; if true it annotates code chunks with a comment\n      giving the line number of the first line in the sources (the\n      behaviour of R &gt;= 2.12.0).\n\n    &#8226; Package installation tangles the vignette sources: this step now\n      converts the vignette sources from the vignette/package encoding\n      to the current encoding, and records the encoding (if not ASCII)\n      in a comment line at the top of the installed .R file.\n\n  LICENCE:\n\n    &#8226; No parts of R are now licensed solely under GPL-2.  The licences\n      for packages rpart and survival have been changed, which means\n      that the licence terms for R as distributed are GPL-2 | GPL-3.\n\n  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:\n\n    &#8226; The internal functions .readRDS() and .saveRDS() are now\n      deprecated in favour of the public functions readRDS() and\n      saveRDS() introduced in R 2.13.0.\n\n    &#8226; Switching off lazy-loading of code _via_ the LazyLoad field of\n      the DESCRIPTION file is now deprecated.  In future all packages\n      will be lazy-loaded.\n\n    &#8226; The off-line help() types &quot;postscript&quot; and &quot;ps&quot; are deprecated.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check on a multi-architecture installation now skips the\n      user's .Renviron file for the architecture-specific tests (which\n      do read the architecture-specific Renviron.site files).  This is\n      consistent with single-architecture checks, which use\n      --no-environ.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD build now looks for DESCRIPTION fields BuildResaveData and\n      BuildKeepEmpty for per-package overrides.  See &#8216;Writing R\n      Extensions&#8217;.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; plot.lm(which = 5) was intended to order factor levels in\n      increasing order of mean standardized residual.  It ordered the\n      factor labels correctly, but could plot the wrong group of\n      residuals against the label.  (PR#14545)\n\n    &#8226; mosaicplot() could clip the factor labels, and could overlap them\n      with the cells if a non-default value of cex.axis was used.\n      (Related to PR#14550.)\n\n    &#8226; dataframe[[row,col]] now dispatches on [[ methods for the\n      selected column (spotted by Bill Dunlap).\n\n    &#8226; sort.int() would strip the class of an object, but leave its\n      object bit set.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    &#8226; pbirthday() and qbirthday() did not implement the algorithm\n      exactly as given in their reference and so were unnecessarily\n      inaccurate.\n\n      pbirthday() now solves the approximate formula analytically\n      rather than using uniroot() on a discontinuous function.\n\n      The description of the problem was inaccurate: the probability is\n      a tail probablity (&#8216;2 _or more_ people share a birthday&#8217;)\n\n    &#8226; Complex arithmetic sometimes warned incorrectly about producing\n      NAs when there were NaNs in the input.\n\n    &#8226; seek(origin = &quot;current&quot;) incorrectly reported it was not\n      implemented for a gzfile() connection.\n\n    &#8226; c(), unlist(), cbind() and rbind() could silently overflow the\n      maximum vector length and cause a segfault.  (PR#14571)\n\n    &#8226; The fonts argument to X11(type = &quot;Xlib&quot;) was being ignored.\n\n    &#8226; Reading (e.g. with readBin()) from a raw connection was not\n      advancing the pointer, so successive reads would read the same\n      value.  (Spotted by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    &#8226; Parsed text containing embedded newlines was printed incorrectly\n      by as.character.srcref().  (Reported by Hadley Wickham.)\n\n    &#8226; decompose() used with a series of a non-integer number of periods\n      returned a seasonal component shorter than the original series.\n      (Reported by Rob Hyndman.)\n\n    &#8226; fields = list() failed for setRefClass().  (Reported by Michael\n      Lawrence.)\n\n    &#8226; Reference classes could not redefine an inherited field which had\n      class &quot;ANY&quot;. (Reported by Janko Thyson.)\n\n    &#8226; Methods that override previously loaded versions will now be\n      installed and called.  (Reported by Iago Mosqueira.)\n\n    &#8226; addmargins() called numeric(apos) rather than\n      numeric(length(apos)).\n\n    &#8226; The HTML help search sometimes produced bad links.  (PR#14608)\n\n    &#8226; Command completion will no longer be broken if tail.default() is\n      redefined by the user. (Problem reported by Henrik Bengtsson.)\n\n    &#8226; LaTeX rendering of markup in titles of help pages has been\n      improved; in particular, \\eqn{} may be used there.\n\n    &#8226; isClass() used its own namespace as the default of the where\n      argument inadvertently.\n\n    &#8226; Rd conversion to latex mis-handled multi-line titles (including\n      cases where there was a blank line in the \\title section).\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000540.html\">R 2.13.1 scheduled for July 8\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000542.html\">[R] R 2.14.0 scheduled for October 31, 2.13.2 for September 30\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#541\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#541\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#541\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#541\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is a development\nrelease which contains a number of new features.\n\nAlso, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed (but notice that serious build issues were fixed in 2.12.2).

(See &#8220;scientific&#8221; entry below.)  This affects\n      _many_ *.Rout.save checks in packages.\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    &#8226; normalizePath() has been moved to the base package (from utils):\n      this is so it can be used by library() and friends.\n\n      It now does tilde expansion.\n\n      It gains new arguments winslash (to select the separator on\n      Windows) and mustWork to control the action if a canonical path\n      cannot be found.\n\n    &#8226; The previously barely documented limit of 256 bytes on a symbol\n      name has been raised to 10,000 bytes (a sanity check).  Long\n      symbol names can sometimes occur when deparsing expressions (for\n      example, in model.frame).\n\n    &#8226; reformulate() gains a intercept argument.\n\n    &#8226; cmdscale(add = FALSE) now uses the more common definition that\n      there is a representation in n-1 or less dimensions, and only\n      dimensions corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used.\n      (Avoids confusion such as PR#14397.)\n\n    &#8226; Names used by c(), unlist(), cbind() and rbind() are marked with\n      an encoding when this can be ascertained.\n\n    &#8226; R colours are now defined to refer to the sRGB color space.\n\n      The PDF, PostScript, and Quartz graphics devices record this\n      fact.  X11 (and Cairo) and Windows just assume that your screen\n      conforms.\n\n    &#8226; system.file() gains a mustWork argument (suggestion of Bill\n      Dunlap).\n\n    &#8226; new.env(hash = TRUE) is now the default.\n\n    &#8226; list2env(envir = NULL) defaults to hashing (with a suitably sized\n      environment) for lists of more than 100 elements.\n\n    &#8226; text() gains a formula method.\n\n    &#8226; IQR() now has a type argument which is passed to quantile().\n\n    &#8226; as.vector(), as.double() etc duplicate less when they leave the\n      mode unchanged but remove attributes.\n\n      as.vector(mode = &quot;any&quot;) no longer duplicates when it does not\n      remove attributes.  This helps memory usage in matrix() and\n      array().\n\n      matrix() duplicates less if data is an atomic vector with\n      attributes such as names (but no class).\n\n      dim(x) &lt;- NULL duplicates less if x has neither dimensions nor\n      names (since this operation removes names and dimnames).\n\n    &#8226; setRepositories() gains an addURLs argument.\n\n    &#8226; chisq.test() now also returns a stdres component, for\n      standardized residuals (which have unit variance, unlike the\n      Pearson residuals).\n\n    &#8226; write.table() and friends gain a fileEncoding argument, to\n      simplify writing files for use on other OSes (e.g. a spreadsheet\n      intended for Windows or Mac OS X Excel).\n\n    &#8226; Assignment expressions of the form foo::bar(x) &lt;- y and\n      foo:::bar(x) &lt;- y now work; the replacement functions used are\n      foo::`bar&lt;-` and foo:::`bar&lt;-`.\n\n    &#8226; Sys.getenv() gains a names argument so Sys.getenv(x, names =\n      FALSE) can replace the common idiom of as.vector(Sys.getenv()).\n      The default has been changed to not name a length-one result.\n\n    &#8226; Lazy loading of environments now preserves attributes and locked\n      status. (The locked status of bindings and active bindings are\n      still not preserved; this may be addressed in the future).\n\n    &#8226; options(&quot;install.lock&quot;) may be set to FALSE so that\n      install.packages() defaults to --no-lock installs, or (on\n      Windows) to TRUE so that binary installs implement locking.\n\n    &#8226; sort(partial = p) for large p now tries Shellsort if quicksort is\n      not appropriate and so works for non-numeric atomic vectors.\n\n    &#8226; sapply() gets a new option simplify = &quot;array&quot; which returns a\n      &#8220;higher rank&#8221; array instead of just a matrix when FUN() returns a\n      dim() length of two or more.\n\n      replicate() has this option set by default, and vapply() now\n      behaves that way internally.\n\n    &#8226; aperm() becomes S3 generic and gets a table method which\n      preserves the class.\n\n    &#8226; merge() and as.hclust() methods for objects of class &quot;dendrogram&quot;\n      are now provided.\n\n    &#8226; as.POSIXlt.factor() now passes ... to the character method\n      (suggestion of Joshua Ulrich).\n\n    &#8226; The character method of as.POSIXlt() now tries to find a format\n      that works for all non-NA inputs, not just the first one.\n\n    &#8226; str() now has a method for class &quot;Date&quot; analogous to that for\n      class &quot;POSIXt&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; New function file.link() to create hard links on those file\n      systems (POSIX, NTFS but not FAT) that support them.\n\n    &#8226; New Summary() group method for class &quot;ordered&quot; implements min(),\n      max() and range() for ordered factors.\n\n    &#8226; mostattributes&lt;-() now consults the &quot;dim&quot; attribute and not the\n      dim() function, making it more useful for objects (such as data\n      frames) from classes with methods for dim().  It also uses\n      attr&lt;-() in preference to the generics name&lt;-(), dim&lt;-() and\n      dimnames&lt;-().  (Related to PR#14469.)\n\n    &#8226; There is a new option &quot;browserNLdisabled&quot; to disable the use of\n      an empty (e.g. via the &#8216;Return&#8217; key) as a synonym for c in\n      browser() or n under debug().  (Wish of PR#14472.)\n\n    &#8226; example() gains optional new arguments character.only and\n      give.lines enabling programmatic exploration.\n\n    &#8226; serialize() and unserialize() are no longer described as\n      &#8216;experimental&#8217;.  The interface is now regarded as stable,\n      although the serialization format may well change in future\n      releases.  (serialize() has a new argument version which would\n      allow the current format to be written if that happens.)\n\n      New functions saveRDS() and readRDS() are public versions of the\n      &#8216;internal&#8217; functions .saveRDS() and .readRDS() made available for\n      general use.  The dot-name versions remain available as several\n      package authors have made use of them, despite the documentation.\n\n      saveRDS() supports compress = &quot;xz&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; Many functions when called with a not-open connection will now\n      ensure that the connection is left not-open in the event of\n      error.  These include read.dcf(), dput(), dump(), load(),\n      parse(), readBin(), readChar(), readLines(), save(), writeBin(),\n      writeChar(), writeLines(), .readRDS(), .saveRDS() and\n      tools::parse_Rd(), as well as functions calling these.\n\n    &#8226; Public functions find.package() and path.package() replace the\n      internal dot-name versions.\n\n    &#8226; The default method for terms() now looks for a &quot;terms&quot; attribute\n      if it does not find a &quot;terms&quot; component, and so works for model\n      frames.\n\n    &#8226; httpd() handlers receive an additional argument containing the\n      full request headers as a raw vector (this can be used to parse\n      cookies, multi-part forms etc.). The recommended full signature\n      for handlers is therefore function(url, query, body, headers,\n      ...).\n\n    &#8226; file.edit() gains a fileEncoding argument to specify the encoding\n      of the file(s).\n\n    &#8226; The format of the HTML package listings has changed.  If there is\n      more than one library tree , a table of links to libraries is\n      provided at the top and bottom of the page.  Where a library\n      contains more than 100 packages, an alphabetic index is given at\n      the top of the section for that library.  (As a consequence,\n      package names are now sorted case-insensitively whatever the\n      locale.)\n\n    &#8226; isSeekable() now returns FALSE on connections which have\n      non-default encoding.  Although documented to record if &#8216;in\n      principle&#8217; the connection supports seeking, it seems safer to\n      report FALSE when it may not work.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD REMOVE and remove.packages() now remove file R.css when\n      removing all remaining packages in a library tree.  (Related to\n      the wish of PR#14475: note that this file is no longer\n      installed.)\n\n    &#8226; unzip() now has a unzip argument like zip.file.extract().  This\n      allows an external unzip program to be used, which can be useful\n      to access features supported by Info-ZIP's unzip version 6 which\n      is now becoming more widely available.\n\n    &#8226; There is a simple zip() function, as wrapper for an external zip\n      command.\n\n    &#8226; bzfile() connections can now read from concatenated bzip2 files\n      (including files written with bzfile(open = &quot;a&quot;)) and files\n      created by some other compressors (such as the example of\n      PR#14479).\n\n    &#8226; The primitive function c() is now of type BUILTIN.\n\n    &#8226; plot(&lt;dendrogram&gt;, .., nodePar=*) now obeys an optional xpd\n      specification (allowing clipping to be turned off completely).\n\n    &#8226; nls(algorithm=&quot;port&quot;) now shares more code with nlminb(), and is\n      more consistent with the other nls() algorithms in its return\n      value.\n\n    &#8226; xz has been updated to 5.0.1 (very minor bugfix release).\n\n    &#8226; image() has gained a logical useRaster argument allowing it to\n      use a bitmap raster for plotting a regular grid instead of\n      polygons. This can be more efficient, but may not be supported by\n      all devices. The default is FALSE.\n\n    &#8226; list.files()/dir() gains a new argument include.dirs() to include\n      directories in the listing when recursive = TRUE.\n\n    &#8226; New function list.dirs() lists all directories, (even empty\n      ones).\n\n    &#8226; file.copy() now (by default) copies read/write/execute\n      permissions on files, moderated by the current setting of\n      Sys.umask().\n\n    &#8226; Sys.umask() now accepts mode = NA and returns the current umask\n      value (visibly) without changing it.\n\n    &#8226; There is a ! method for classes &quot;octmode&quot; and &quot;hexmode&quot;: this\n      allows xor(a, b) to work if both a and b are from one of those\n      classes.\n\n    &#8226; as.raster() no longer fails for vectors or matrices containing\n      NAs.\n\n    &#8226; New hook &quot;before.new.plot&quot; allows functions to be run just before\n      advancing the frame in plot.new, which is potentially useful for\n      custom figure layout implementations.\n\n    &#8226; Package tools has a new function compactPDF() to try to reduce\n      the size of PDF files _via_ qpdf or gs.\n\n    &#8226; tar() has a new argument extra_flags.\n\n    &#8226; dotchart() accepts more general objects x such as 1D tables which\n      can be coerced by as.numeric() to a numeric vector, with a\n      warning since that might not be appropriate.\n\n    &#8226; The previously internal function create.post() is now exported\n      from utils, and the documentation for bug.report() and\n      help.request() now refer to that for create.post().\n\n      It has a new method = &quot;mailto&quot; on Unix-alikes similar to that on\n      Windows: it invokes a default mailer via open (Mac OS X) or\n      xdg-open or the default browser (elsewhere).\n\n      The default for ccaddress is now getOption(&quot;ccaddress&quot;) which is\n      by default unset: using the username as a mailing address\n      nowadays rarely works as expected.\n\n    &#8226; The default for options(&quot;mailer&quot;) is now &quot;mailto&quot; on all\n      platforms.\n\n    &#8226; unlink() now does tilde-expansion (like most other file\n      functions).\n\n    &#8226; file.rename() now allows vector arguments (of the same length).\n\n    &#8226; The &quot;glm&quot; method for logLik() now returns an &quot;nobs&quot; attribute\n      (which stats4::BIC() assumed it did).\n\n      The &quot;nls&quot; method for logLik() gave incorrect results for zero\n      weights.\n\n    &#8226; There is a new generic function nobs() in package stats, to\n      extract from model objects a suitable value for use in BIC\n      calculations.  An S4 generic derived from it is defined in\n      package stats4.\n\n    &#8226; Code for S4 reference-class methods is now examined for possible\n      errors in non-local assignments.\n\n    &#8226; findClasses, getGeneric, findMethods and hasMethods are revised\n      to deal consistently with the package= argument and be consistent\n      with soft namespace policy for finding objects.\n\n    &#8226; tools::Rdiff() now has the option to return not only the status\n      but a character vector of observed differences (which are still\n      by default sent to stdout).\n\n    &#8226; The startup environment variables R_ENVIRON_USER, R_ENVIRON,\n      R_PROFILE_USER and R_PROFILE are now treated more consistently.\n      In all cases an empty value is considered to be set and will stop\n      the default being used, and for the last two tilde expansion is\n      performed on the file name.  (Note that setting an empty value is\n      probably impossible on Windows.)\n\n    &#8226; Using R --no-environ CMD, R --no-site-file CMD or R\n      --no-init-file CMD sets environment variables so these settings\n      are passed on to child R processes, notably those run by INSTALL,\n      check and build. R --vanilla CMD sets these three options (but\n      not --no-restore).\n\n    &#8226; smooth.spline() is somewhat faster.  With cv=NA it allows some\n      leverage computations to be skipped,\n\n    &#8226; The internal (C) function scientific(), at the heart of R's\n      format.info(x), format(x), print(x), etc, for numeric x, has been\n      re-written in order to provide slightly more correct results,\n      fixing PR#14491, notably in border cases including when digits &gt;=\n      16, thanks to substantial contributions (code and experiments)\n      from Petr Savicky.  This affects a noticable amount of numeric\n      output from R.\n\n    &#8226; A new function grepRaw() has been introduced for finding subsets\n      of raw vectors. It supports both literal searches and regular\n      expressions.\n\n    &#8226; Package compiler is now provided as a standard package.  See\n      ?compiler::compile for information on how to use the compiler.\n      This package implements a byte code compiler for R: by default\n      the compiler is not used in this release.  See the &#8216;R\n      Installation and Administration Manual&#8217; for how to compile the\n      base and recommended packages.\n\n    &#8226; Providing an exportPattern directive in a NAMESPACE file now\n      causes classes to be exported according to the same pattern, for\n      example the default from package.skeleton() to specify all names\n      starting with a letter.  An explicit directive to\n      exportClassPattern will still over-ride.\n\n    &#8226; There is an additional marked encoding &quot;bytes&quot; for character\n      strings.  This is intended to be used for non-ASCII strings which\n      should be treated as a set of bytes, and never re-encoded as if\n      they were in the encoding of the currrent locale: useBytes = TRUE\n      is autmatically selected in functions such as writeBin(),\n      writeLines(), grep() and strsplit().\n\n      Only a few character operations are supported (such as substr()).\n\n      Printing, format() and cat() will represent non-ASCII bytes in\n      such strings by a \\xab escape.\n\n    &#8226; The new function removeSource() removes the internally stored\n      source from a function.\n\n    &#8226; &quot;srcref&quot; attributes now include two additional line number\n      values, recording the line numbers in the order they were parsed.\n\n    &#8226; New functions have been added for source reference access:\n      getSrcFilename(), getSrcDirectory(), getSrcLocation() and\n      getSrcref().\n\n    &#8226; Sys.chmod() has an extra argument use_umask which defaults to\n      true and restricts the file mode by the current setting of umask.\n      This means that all the R functions which manipulate\n      file/directory permissions by default respect umask, notably R\n      CMD INSTALL.\n\n    &#8226; tempfile() has an extra argument fileext to create a temporary\n      filename with a specified extension.  (Suggestion and initial\n      implementation by Dirk Eddelbuettel.)\n\n      There are improvements in the way Sweave() and Stangle() handle\n      non-ASCII vignette sources, especially in a UTF-8 locale: see\n      &#8216;Writing R Extensions&#8217; which now has a subsection on this topic.\n\n    &#8226; factanal() now returns the rotation matrix if a rotation such as\n      &quot;promax&quot; is used, and hence factor correlations are displayed.\n      (Wish of PR#12754.)\n\n    &#8226; The gctorture2() function provides a more refined interface to\n      the GC torture process.  Environment variables R_GCTORTURE,\n      R_GCTORTURE_WAIT, and R_GCTORTURE_INHIBIT_RELEASE can also be\n      used to control the GC torture process.\n\n    &#8226; file.copy(from, to) no longer regards it as an error to supply a\n      zero-length from: it now simply does nothing.\n\n    &#8226; rstandard.glm gains a type argument which can be used to request\n      standardized Pearson residuals.\n\n    &#8226; A start on a Turkish translation, thanks to Murat Alkan.\n\n    &#8226; .libPaths() calls normalizePath(winslash = &quot;/&quot;) on the paths:\n      this helps (usually) present them in a user-friendly form and\n      should detect duplicate paths accessed via different symbolic\n      links.\n\n  SWEAVE CHANGES:\n\n    &#8226; Sweave() has options to produce PNG and JPEG figures, and to use\n      a custom function to open a graphics device (see ?RweaveLatex).\n      (Based in part on the contribution of PR#14418.)\n\n    &#8226; The default for Sweave() is to produce only PDF figures (rather\n      than both EPS and PDF).\n\n    &#8226; Environment variable SWEAVE_OPTIONS can be used to supply\n      defaults for existing or new options to be applied after the\n      Sweave driver setup has been run.\n\n    &#8226; The Sweave manual is now included as a vignette in the utils\n      package.\n\n    &#8226; Sweave() handles keep.source=TRUE much better: it could duplicate\n      some lines and omit comments. (Reported by John Maindonald and\n      others.)\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    &#8226; Because they use a C99 interface which a C++ compiler is not\n      required to support, Rvprintf and REvprintf are only defined by\n      R_ext/Print.h in C++ code if the macro R_USE_C99_IN_CXX is\n      defined when it is included.\n\n    &#8226; pythag duplicated the C99 function hypot.  It is no longer\n      provided, but is used as a substitute for hypot in the very\n      unlikely event that the latter is not available.\n\n    &#8226; R_inspect(obj) and R_inspect3(obj, deep, pvec) are (hidden)\n      C-level entry points to the internal inspect function and can be\n      used for C-level debugging (e.g., in conjunction with the p\n      command in gdb).\n\n    &#8226; Compiling R with --enable-strict-barrier now also enables\n      additional checking for use of unprotected objects. In\n      combination with gctorture() or gctorture2() and a C-level\n      debugger this can be useful for tracking down memory protection\n      issues.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Rdiff is now implemented in R on Unix-alikes (as it has\n      been on Windows since R 2.12.0).\n\n    &#8226; R CMD build no longer does any cleaning in the supplied package\n      directory: all the cleaning is done in the copy.\n\n      It has a new option --install-args to pass arguments to R CMD\n      INSTALL for --build (but not when installing to rebuild\n      vignettes).\n\n      There is new option, --resave-data, to call\n      tools::resaveRdaFiles() on the data directory, to compress\n      tabular files (.tab, .csv etc) and to convert .R files to .rda\n      files.  The default, --resave-data=gzip, is to do so in a way\n      compatible even with years-old versions of R, but better\n      compression is given by --resave-data=best, requiring R &gt;=\n      2.10.0.\n\n      It now adds a datalist file for data directories of more than\n      1Mb.\n\n      Patterns in .Rbuildignore are now also matched against all\n      directory names (including those of empty directories).\n\n      There is a new option, --compact-vignettes, to try reducing the\n      size of PDF files in the inst/doc directory.  Currently this\n      tries qpdf: other options may be used in future.\n\n      When re-building vignettes and a inst/doc/Makefile file is found,\n      make clean is run if the makefile has a clean: target.\n\n      After re-building vignettes the default clean-up operation will\n      remove any directories (and not just files) created during the\n      process: e.g. one package created a .R_cache directory.\n\n      Empty directories are now removed unless the option\n      --keep-empty-dirs is given (and a few packages do deliberately\n      include empty directories).\n\n      If there is a field BuildVignettes in the package DESCRIPTION\n      file with a false value, re-building the vignettes is skipped.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check now also checks for filenames that are\n      case-insensitive matches to Windows' reserved file names with\n      extensions, such as nul.Rd, as these have caused problems on some\n      Windows systems.\n\n      It checks for inefficiently saved data/*.rda and data/*.RData\n      files, and reports on those large than 100Kb.  A more complete\n      check (including of the type of compression, but potentially much\n      slower) can be switched on by setting environment variable\n      _R_CHECK_COMPACT_DATA2_ to TRUE.\n\n      The types of files in the data directory are now checked, as\n      packages are _still_ misusing it for non-R data files.\n\n      It now extracts and runs the R code for each vignette in a\n      separate directory and R process: this is done in the package's\n      declared encoding.  Rather than call tools::checkVignettes(), it\n      calls tool::buildVignettes() to see if the vignettes can be\n      re-built as they would be by R CMD build.  Option --use-valgrind\n      now applies only to these runs, and not when running code to\n      rebuild the vignettes.  This version does a much better job of\n      suppressing output from successful vignette tests.\n\n      The 00check.log file is a more complete record of what is output\n      to stdout: in particular contains more details of the tests.\n\n      It now check all syntactically valid Rd usage entries, and warns\n      about assignments (unless these give the usage of replacement\n      functions).\n\n      .tar.xz compressed tarballs are now allowed, if tar supports them\n      (and setting environment variable TAR to internal ensures so on\n      all platforms).\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check now warns if it finds inst/doc/makefile, and R CMD\n      build renames such a file to inst/doc/Makefile.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; Installing R no longer tries to find perl, and R CMD no longer\n      tries to substitute a full path for awk nor perl - this was a\n      legacy from the days when they were used by R itself.  Because a\n      couple of packages do use awk, it is set as the make (rather than\n      environment) variable AWK.\n\n    &#8226; make check will now fail if there are differences from the\n      reference output when testing package examples and if environment\n      variable R_STRICT_PACKAGE_CHECK is set to a true value.\n\n    &#8226; The C99 double complex type is now required.\n\n      The C99 complex trigonometric functions (such as csin) are not\n      currently required (FreeBSD lacks most of them): substitutes are\n      used if they are missing.\n\n    &#8226; The C99 system call va_copy is now required.\n\n    &#8226; If environment variable R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set during\n      configuration (for example in config.site) it is used unchanged\n      in file etc/ldpaths rather than being appended to.\n\n    &#8226; configure looks for support for OpenMP and if found compiles R\n      with appropriate flags and also makes them available for use in\n      packages: see &#8216;Writing R Extensions&#8217;.\n\n      This is currently experimental, and is only used in R with a\n      single thread for colSums() and colMeans().  Expect it to be more\n      widely used in later versions of R.\n\n      This can be disabled by the --disable-openmp flag.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; R CMD INSTALL --clean now removes copies of a src directory which\n      are created when multiple sub-architectures are in use.\n      (Following a comment from Berwin Turlach.)\n\n    &#8226; File R.css is now installed on a per-package basis (in the\n      package's html directory) rather than in each library tree, and\n      this is used for all the HTML pages in the package.  This helps\n      when installing packages with static HTML pages for use on a\n      webserver.  It will also allow future versions of R to use\n      different stylesheets for the packages they install.\n\n    &#8226; A top-level file .Rinstignore in the package sources can list (in\n      the same way as .Rbuildignore) files under inst that should not\n      be installed.  (Why should there be any such files?  Because all\n      the files needed to re-build vignettes need to be under inst/doc,\n      but they may not need to be installed.)\n\n    &#8226; R CMD INSTALL has a new option --compact-docs to compact any PDFs\n      under the inst/doc directory.  Currently this uses qpdf, which\n      must be installed (see &#8216;Writing R Extensions&#8217;).\n\n    &#8226; There is a new option --lock which can be used to cancel the\n      effect of --no-lock or --pkglock earlier on the command line.\n\n    &#8226; Option --pkglock can now be used with more than one package, and\n      is now the default if only one package is specified.\n\n    &#8226; Argument lock of install.packages() can now be use for Mac binary\n      installs as well as for Windows ones.  The value &quot;pkglock&quot; is now\n      accepted, as well as TRUE and FALSE (the default).\n\n    &#8226; There is a new option --no-clean-on-error for R CMD INSTALL to\n      retain a partially installed package for forensic analysis.\n\n    &#8226; Packages with names ending in . are not portable since Windows\n      does not work correctly with such directory names.  This is now\n      warned about in R CMD check, and will not be allowed in R 2.14.x.\n\n    &#8226; The vignette indices are more comprehensive (in the style of\n      browseVignetttes()).\n\n  DEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT:\n\n    &#8226; require(save = TRUE) is defunct, and use of the save argument is\n      deprecated.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check --no-latex is defunct: use --no-manual instead.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Sd2Rd is defunct.\n\n    &#8226; The gamma argument to hsv(), rainbow(), and rgb2hsv() is\n      deprecated and no longer has any effect.\n\n    &#8226; The previous options for R CMD build --binary (--auto-zip,\n      --use-zip-data and --no-docs) are deprecated (or defunct): use\n      the new option --install-args instead.\n\n    &#8226; When a character value is used for the EXPR argument in switch(),\n      only a single unnamed alternative value is now allowed.\n\n    &#8226; The wrapper utils::link.html.help() is no longer available.\n\n    &#8226; Zip-ing data sets in packages (and hence R CMD INSTALL options\n      --use-zip-data and --auto-zip, as well as the ZipData: yes field\n      in a DESCRIPTION file) is defunct.\n\n      Installed packages with zip-ed data sets can still be used, but a\n      warning that they should be re-installed will be given.\n\n    &#8226; The &#8216;experimental&#8217; alternative specification of a name space via\n      .Export() etc is now defunct.\n\n    &#8226; The option --unsafe to R CMD INSTALL is deprecated: use the\n      identical option --no-lock instead.\n\n    &#8226; The entry point pythag in Rmath.h is deprecated in favour of the\n      C99 function hypot.  A wrapper for hypot is provided for R 2.13.x\n      only.\n\n    &#8226; Direct access to the &quot;source&quot; attribute of functions is\n      deprecated; use deparse(fn, control=&quot;useSource&quot;) to access it,\n      and removeSource(fn) to remove it.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD build --binary is now formally deprecated: R CMD INSTALL\n      --build has long been the preferred alternative.\n\n    &#8226; Single-character package names are deprecated (and R is already\n      disallowed to avoid confusion in Depends: fields).\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; drop.terms and the [ method for class &quot;terms&quot; no longer add back\n      an intercept.  (Reported by Niels Hansen.)\n\n    &#8226; aggregate preserves the class of a column (e.g. a date) under\n      some circumstances where it discarded the class previously.\n\n    &#8226; p.adjust() now always returns a vector result, as documented.  In\n      previous versions it copied attributes (such as dimensions) from\n      the p argument: now it only copies names.\n\n    &#8226; On PDF and PostScript devices, a line width of zero was recorded\n      verbatim and this caused problems for some viewers (a very thin\n      line combined with a non-solid line dash pattern could also cause\n      a problem).  On these devices, the line width is now limited at\n      0.01 and for very thin lines with complex dash patterns the\n      device may force the line dash pattern to be solid.  (Reported by\n      Jari Oksanen.)\n\n    &#8226; The str() method for class &quot;POSIXt&quot; now gives sensible output for\n      0-length input.\n\n    &#8226; The one- and two-argument complex maths functions failed to warn\n      if NAs were generated (as their numeric analogues do).\n\n    &#8226; Added .requireCachedGenerics to the dont.mind list for library()\n      to avoid warnings about duplicates.\n\n    &#8226; $&lt;-.data.frame messed with the class attribute, breaking any S4\n      subclass.  The S4 data.frame class now has its own $&lt;- method,\n      and turns dispatch on for this primitive.\n\n    &#8226; Map() did not look up a character argument f in the correct\n      frame, thanks to lazy evaluation.  (PR#14495)\n\n    &#8226; file.copy() did not tilde-expand from and to when to was a\n      directory.  (PR#14507)\n\n    &#8226; It was possible (but very rare) for the loading test in R CMD\n      INSTALL to crash a child R process and so leave around a lock\n      directory and a partially installed package.  That test is now\n      done in a separate process.\n\n    &#8226; plot(&lt;formula&gt;, data=&lt;matrix&gt;,..) now works in more cases;\n      similarly for points(), lines() and text().\n\n    &#8226; edit.default() contained a manual dispatch for matrices (the\n      &quot;matrix&quot; class didn't really exist when it was written).  This\n      caused an infinite recursion in the no-GUI case and has now been\n      removed.\n\n    &#8226; data.frame(check.rows = TRUE) sometimes worked when it should\n      have detected an error.  (PR#14530)\n\n    &#8226; scan(sep= , strip.white=TRUE) sometimes stripped trailing spaces\n      from within quoted strings.  (The real bug in PR#14522.)\n\n    &#8226; The rank-correlation methods for cor() and cov() with use =\n      &quot;complete.obs&quot; computed the ranks before removing missing values,\n      whereas the documentation implied incomplete cases were removed\n      first.  (PR#14488)\n\n      They also failed for 1-row matrices.\n\n    &#8226; The perpendicular adjustment used in placing text and expressions\n      in the margins of plots was not scaled by par(&quot;mex&quot;). (Part of\n      PR#14532.)\n\n    &#8226; Quartz Cocoa device now catches any Cocoa exceptions that occur\n      during the creation of the device window to prevent crashes.  It\n      also imposes a limit of 144 ft^2 on the area used by a window to\n      catch user errors (unit misinterpretation) early.\n\n    &#8226; The browser (invoked by debug(), browser() or otherwise) would\n      display attributes such as &quot;wholeSrcref&quot; that were intended for\n      internal use only.\n\n    &#8226; R's internal filename completion now properly handles filenames\n      with spaces in them even when the readline library is used.  This\n      resolves PR#14452 provided the internal filename completion is\n      used (e.g., by setting rc.settings(files = TRUE)).\n\n    &#8226; Inside uniroot(f, ...), -Inf function values are now replaced by\n      a maximally *negative* value.\n\n    &#8226; rowsum() could silently over/underflow on integer inputs\n      (reported by Bill Dunlap).\n\n    &#8226; as.matrix() did not handle &quot;dist&quot; objects with zero rows.\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2 patched:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    &#8226; max() and min() work harder to ensure that NA has precedence over\n      NaN, so e.g. min(NaN, NA) is NA.  (This was not previously\n      documented except for within a single numeric vector, where\n      compiler optimizations often defeated the code.)\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; A change to the C function R_tryEval had broken error messages in\n      S4 method selection; the error message is now printed.\n\n    &#8226; PDF output with a non-RGB color model used RGB for the line\n      stroke color.  (PR#14511)\n\n    &#8226; stats4::BIC() assumed without checking that an object of class\n      &quot;logLik&quot; has an &quot;nobs&quot; attribute: glm() fits did not and so BIC()\n      failed for them.\n\n    &#8226; In some circumstances a one-sided mantelhaen.test() reported the\n      p-value for the wrong tail.  (PR#14514)\n\n    &#8226; Passing the invalid value lty = NULL to axis() sent an invalid\n      value to the graphics device, and might cause the device to\n      segfault.\n\n    &#8226; Sweave() with concordance=TRUE could lead to invalid PDF files;\n      Sweave.sty has been updated to avoid this.\n\n    &#8226; Non-ASCII characters in the titles of help pages were not\n      rendered properly in some locales, and could cause errors or\n      warnings.\n\n    &#8226; checkRd() gave a spurious error if the \\href macro was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000537.html\">CONFERENCE: useR! 2011, August 16-18, University of Warwick,\tearly bird deadline\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000539.html\">The R Journal Vol. 3/1 now published\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#538\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#538\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#538\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#538\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues, and one major issue in which complex arithmetic was being messed up on some compiler platform.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.2.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.2.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n    For the R Core Team\n\n    Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = ac9746b4845ae866661f51cfc99262f5\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 72deeabefdf6fd14e83bf5703dce9176\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 30b55e4f34c155fcb2fafa7ebb55528e\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = b0d650eba25fc5664980528c147a20db\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = bc70b51dddab8aa39066710624e55d5e\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = f2ccf22f3e20ebaa86f8ee5cc6b0f655\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.12.2.tar.gz) = bc70b51dddab8aa39066710624e55d5e\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\nR News\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.2:\n\n  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:\n\n    &#8226; Complex arithmetic (notably z^n for complex z and integer n) gave\n      incorrect results since R 2.10.0 on platforms without C99 complex\n      support.  This and some lesser issues in trignometric functions\n      have been corrected.\n\n      Such platforms were rare (we know of Cygwin and FreeBSD).\n      However, because of new compiler optimizations in the way complex\n      arguments are handled, the same code was selected on x86_64 Linux\n      with gcc 4.5.x at the default -O2 optimization (but not at -O).\n\n    &#8226; There is a workaround for crashes seen with several packages on\n      systems using zlib 1.2.5: see the INSTALLATION section.\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    &#8226; PCRE has been updated to 8.12 (two bug-fix releases since 8.10).\n\n    &#8226; rep(), seq(), seq.int() and seq_len() report more often when the\n      first element is taken of an argument of incorrect length.\n\n    &#8226; The Cocoa back-end for the quartz() graphics device on Mac OS X\n      provides a way to disable event loop processing temporarily\n      (useful, e.g., for forked instances of R).\n\n    &#8226; kernel()'s default for m was not appropriate if coef was a set of\n      coefficients.  (Reported by Pierre Chausse.)\n\n    &#8226; bug.report() has been updated for the current R bug tracker,\n      which does not accept emailed submissions.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check now checks for the correct use of $(LAPACK_LIBS) (as\n      well as $(BLAS_LIBS)), since several CRAN recent submissions have\n      ignored &#8216;Writing R Extensions&#8217;.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; The zlib sources in the distribution are now built with all\n      symbols remapped: this is intended to avoid problems seen with\n      packages such as XML and rggobi which link to zlib.so.1 on\n      systems using zlib 1.2.5.\n\n    &#8226; The default for FFLAGS and FCFLAGS with gfortran on x86_64 Linux\n      has been changed back to -g -O2: however, setting -g -O may still\n      be needed for gfortran 4.3.x.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; A LazyDataCompression field in the DESCRIPTION file will be used\n      to set the value for the --data-compress option of R CMD INSTALL.\n\n    &#8226; Files R/sysdata.rda of more than 1Mb are now stored in the\n      lazyload daabase using xz compression: this for example halves\n      the installed size of package Imap.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD INSTALL now ensures that directories installed from inst\n      have search permission for everyone.\n\n      It no longer installs files inst/doc/Rplots.ps and\n      inst/doc/Rplots.pdf.  These are almost certainly left-overs from\n      Sweave runs, and are often large.\n\n  DEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT:\n\n    &#8226; The &#8216;experimental&#8217; alternative specification of a name space via\n      .Export() etc is now deprecated.\n\n    &#8226; zip.file.extract() is now deprecated.\n\n    &#8226; Zip-ing data sets in packages (and hence R CMD INSTALL\n      --use-zip-data and the ZipData: yes field in a DESCRIPTION file)\n      is deprecated: using efficiently compressed .rda images and\n      lazy-loading of data has superseded it.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; identical() could in rare cases generate a warning about\n      non-pairlist attributes on CHARSXPs.  As these are used for\n      internal purposes, the attribute check should be skipped.\n      (Reported by Niels Richard Hansen).\n\n    &#8226; If the filename extension (usually .Rnw) was not included in a\n      call to Sweave(), source references would not work properly and\n      the keep.source option failed.  (PR#14459)\n\n    &#8226; format.data.frame() now keeps zero character column names.\n\n    &#8226; pretty(x) no longer raises an error when x contains solely\n      non-finite values. (PR#14468)\n\n    &#8226; The plot.TukeyHSD() function now uses a line width of 0.5 for its\n      reference lines rather than lwd = 0 (which caused problems for\n      some PDF and PostScript viewers).\n\n    &#8226; The big.mark argument to prettyNum(), format(), etc. was inserted\n      reversed if it was more than one character long.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check failed to check the filenames under man for Windows'\n      reserved names.\n\n    &#8226; The &quot;Date&quot; and &quot;POSIXt&quot; methods for seq() could overshoot when to\n      was supplied and by was specified in months or years.\n\n    &#8226; The internal method of untar() now restores hard links as file\n      copies rather than symbolic links (which did not work for\n      cross-directory links).\n\n    &#8226; unzip() did not handle zip files which contained filepaths with\n      two or more leading directories which were not in the zipfile and\n      did not already exist.  (It is unclear if such zipfiles are valid\n      and the third-party C code used did not support them, but\n      PR#14462 created one.)\n\n    &#8226; combn(n, m) now behaves more regularly for the border case m = 0.\n      (PR#14473)\n\n    &#8226; The rendering of numbers in plotmath expressions (e.g.\n      expression(10^2)) used the current settings for conversion to\n      strings rather than setting the defaults, and so could be\n      affected by what has been done before.  (PR#14477)\n\n    &#8226; The methods of napredict() and naresid() for na.action =\n      na.exclude fits did not work correctly in the very rare event\n      that every case had been omitted in the fit.  (Reported by Simon\n      Wood.)\n\n    &#8226; weighted.residuals(drop0=TRUE) returned a vector when the\n      residuals were a matrix (e.g. those of class &quot;mlm&quot;).  (Reported\n      by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    &#8226; Package HTML index files &lt;pkg&gt;/html/00Index.html were generated\n      with a stylesheet reference that was not correct for static\n      browsing in libraries.\n\n    &#8226; ccf(na.action = na.pass) was not implemented.\n\n    &#8226; The parser accepted some incorrect numeric constants, e.g. 20x2.\n      (Reported by Olaf Mersmann.)\n\n    &#8226; format(*, zero.print) did not always replace the full zero parts.\n\n    &#8226; Fixes for subsetting or subassignment of &quot;raster&quot; objects when\n      not both i and j are specified.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD INSTALL was not always respecting the ZipData: yes field of\n      a DESCRIPTION file (although this is frequently incorrectly\n      specified for packages with no data or which specify lazy-loading\n      of data).\n\n      R CMD INSTALL --use-zip-data was incorrectly implemented as\n      --use-zipdata since R 2.9.0.\n\n    &#8226; source(file, echo=TRUE) could fail if the file contained #line\n      directives.  It now recovers more gracefully, but may still\n      display the wrong line if the directive gives incorrect\n      information.\n\n    &#8226; atan(1i) returned NaN+Infi (rather than 0+Infi) on platforms\n      without C99 complex support.\n\n    &#8226; library() failed to cache S4 metadata (unlike loadNamespace())\n      causing failures in S4-using packages without a namespace (e.g.\n      those using reference classes).\n\n    &#8226; The function qlogis(lp, log.p=TRUE) no longer prematurely\n      overflows to Inf when exp(lp) is close to 1.\n\n    &#8226; Updating S4 methods for a group generic function requires\n      resetting the methods tables for the members of the group (patch\n      contributed by Martin Morgan).\n\n    &#8226; In some circumstances (including for package XML), R CMD INSTALL\n      installed version-control directories from source packages.\n\n    &#8226; Added PROTECT calls to some constructed expressions used in C\n      level eval calls.\n\n    &#8226; utils:::create.post() (used by bug.report() and help.request())\n      failed to quote arguments to the mailer, and so often failed.\n\n    &#8226; bug.report() was naive about how to extract maintainer email\n      addresses from package descriptions, so would often try mailing\n      to incorrect addresses.\n\n    &#8226; debugger() could fail to read the environment of a call to a\n      function with a ... argument.  (Reported by Charlie Roosen.)\n\n    &#8226; prettyNum(c(1i, NA), drop0=TRUE) or str(NA_complex_) now work\n      correctly.\n\n-- \nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000534.html\">R 2.12.2 scheduled for February 25\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000536.html\">R 2.13.0 scheduled for April 13\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#535\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#535\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#535\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#535\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues, and some consolidation within the area of reference classes. The most serious issues were probably that we were not catching misspelled NAMESPACE directives and not catching accidentally unnamed switch() arguments (notice that fixing either will likely uncover errors in preexisting code) \n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.1.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.12.1.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n     For the R Core Team\n\n     Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = ac9746b4845ae866661f51cfc99262f5\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 49b596b26b3e5c082dfde8bacfdffcb0\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 453317871e758763aa9bf385b545bdc6\nMD5 (ONEWS) = 0c3e10eef74439786e5fceddd06dac71\nMD5 (OONEWS) = 58d5b3b614888a6e366ff0c60073584f\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = 078e8d1179fc9a762e326e6da2725468\nMD5 (README) = 296871fcf14f49787910c57b92655c76\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = f2ccf22f3e20ebaa86f8ee5cc6b0f655\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.12.1.tar.gz) = 078e8d1179fc9a762e326e6da2725468\n\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\nR News\n\nCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.12.1:\n\n  NEW FEATURES:\n\n    &#8226; The DVI/PDF reference manual now includes the help pages for all\n      the standard packages: splines, stats4 and tcltk were previously\n      omitted (intentionally).\n\n    &#8226; &lt;URL: <A HREF=\"http://www.rforge.net\">http://www.rforge.net</A>&gt; has been added to the default set of\n      repositories known to setRepositories().\n\n    &#8226; xz-utils has been updated to version 5.0.0.\n\n    &#8226; reshape() now makes use of sep when forming names during\n      reshaping to wide format.  (PR#14435)\n\n    &#8226; legend() allows the length of lines to be set by the end user\n      _via_ the new argument seg.len.\n\n    &#8226; New reference class utility methods copy(), field(),\n      getRefClass() and getClass() have been added.\n\n    &#8226; When a character value is used for the EXPR argument in switch(),\n      a warning is given if more than one unnamed alternative value is\n      given.  This will become an error in R 2.13.0.\n\n    &#8226; StructTS(type = &quot;BSM&quot;) now allows series with just two seasons.\n      (Reported by Birgit Erni.)\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; The PDF reference manual is now built as PDF version 1.5 with\n      object compression, which on platforms for which this is not the\n      default (notably MiKTeX) halves its size.\n\n    &#8226; Variable FCLIBS can be set during configuration, for any\n      additional library flags needed when linking a shared object with\n      the Fortran 9x compiler.  (Needed with Solaris Studio 12.2.)\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; seq.int() no longer sometimes evaluates arguments twice.\n      (PR#14388)\n\n    &#8226; The data.frame method of format() failed if a column name was\n      longer than 256 bytes (the maximum length allowed for an R name).\n\n    &#8226; predict(&lt;lm object&gt;, type =&quot;terms&quot;, ...) failed if both terms and\n      interval were specified.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n      Also, if se.fit = TRUE the standard errors were reported for all\n      terms, not just those selected by a non-null terms.\n\n    &#8226; The TRE regular expressions engine could terminate R rather than\n      give an error when given certain invalid regular expressions.\n      (PR#14398)\n\n    &#8226; cmdscale(eig = TRUE) was documented to return n-1 eigenvalues but\n      in fact only returned k.  It now returns all n eigenvalues.\n\n      cmdscale(add = TRUE) failed to centre the return configuration\n      and sometimes lost the labels on the points.  Its return value\n      was described wrongly (it is always a list and contains component\n      ac).\n\n    &#8226; promptClass() in package methods now works for reference classes\n      and gives a suitably specialized skeleton of documentation.\n\n      Also, callSuper() now works via the methods() invocation as well\n      as for initially specified methods.\n\n    &#8226; download.file() could leave the destination file open if the URL\n      was not able to be opened.  (PR#14414)\n\n    &#8226; Assignment of an environment to functions or as an attribute to\n      other objects now works for S4 subclasses of &quot;environment&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; Use of [[&lt;- for S4 subclasses of &quot;environment&quot; generated an\n      infinite recursion from the method.  The method has been replaced\n      by internal code.\n\n    &#8226; In a reference class S4 method, callSuper() now works in\n      initialize() methods when there is no explicit superclass method.\n\n    &#8226; ! dropped attributes such as names and dimensions from a\n      length-zero argument.  (PR#14424)\n\n    &#8226; When list2env() created an environment it was missing a PROTECT\n      call and so was vulnerable to garbage collection.\n\n    &#8226; Sweave() with keep.source=TRUE dropped comments at the start and\n      end of code chunks.  It could also fail when \\SweaveInput was\n      combined with named chunks.\n\n    &#8226; The Fortran code used by nls(algorithm = &quot;port&quot;) could\n      infinite-loop when compiled with high optimization on a modern\n      version of gcc, and SAFE_FFLAGS is now used to make this less\n      likely.  (PR#14427, seen with 32-bit Windows using gcc 4.5.0 used\n      from R 2.12.0.)\n\n    &#8226; sapply() with default simplify = TRUE and mapply() with default\n      SIMPLIFY = TRUE wrongly simplified language-like results, as,\n      e.g., in mapply(1:2, c(3,7), FUN = function(i,j) call(':',i,j)).\n\n    &#8226; Backreferences to undefined patterns in [g]sub(pcre = TRUE) could\n      cause a segfault.  (PR#14431)\n\n    &#8226; The format() (and hence the print()) method for class &quot;Date&quot;\n      rounded fractional dates towards zero: it now always rounds them\n      down.\n\n    &#8226; Reference S4 class creation could generate ambiguous inheritance\n      patterns under very special circumstances.\n\n    &#8226; [[&lt;- turned S4 subclasses of &quot;environment&quot; into plain\n      environments.\n\n    &#8226; Long titles for help pages were truncated in package indices and\n      a few other places.\n\n    &#8226; Additional utilities now work correctly with S4 subclasses of\n      &quot;environment&quot; (rm, locking tools and active bindings).\n\n    &#8226; spec.ar() now also work for the &quot;ols&quot; method.  (Reported by\n      Hans-Ruedi Kuensch.)\n\n    &#8226; The initialization of objects from S4 subclasses of &quot;environment&quot;\n      now allocates a new environment object.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check has more protection against (probably erroneous)\n      example or test output which is invalid in the current locale.\n\n    &#8226; qr.X() with column names and pivoting now also pivots the column\n      names.  (PR#14438)\n\n    &#8226; unit.pmax() and unit.pmin() in package grid gave incorrect\n      results when all inputs were of length 1.  (PR#14443)\n\n    &#8226; The parser for NAMESPACE files ignored misspelled directives,\n      rather than signalling an error.  For 2.12.x a warning will be\n      issued, but this will be correctly reported as an error in later\n      releases. (Reported by Charles Berry.)\n\n    &#8226; Fix for subsetting of &quot;raster&quot; objects when only one of i or j is\n      specified.\n\n    &#8226; grid.raster() in package grid did not accept &quot;nativeRaster&quot;\n      objects (like rasterImage() does).\n\n    &#8226; Rendering raster images in PDF output was resetting the clipping\n      region.\n\n    &#8226; Rendering of raster images on Cairo X11 device was wrong,\n      particularly when a small image was being scaled up using\n      interpolation.\n\n      With Cairo &lt; 1.6, will be better than before, though still a\n      little clunky.  With Cairo &gt;= 1.6, should be sweet as.\n\n    &#8226; Several bugs fixed in read.DIF(): single column inputs caused\n      errors, cells marked as &quot;character&quot; could be converted to other\n      types, and (in Windows) copying from the clipboard failed.\n\n-- \nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000530.html\">R 2.12.1 scheduled for December 16 \n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000532.html\">[R] The R Journal, Vol.2 Issue 2\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#531\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#531\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#531\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#531\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

(Wish of PR#14182.)\n\n    &#8226; pretty() is now generic, with new methods for &quot;Date&quot; and &quot;POSIXt&quot;\n      classes (based on code contributed by Felix Andrews).\n\n    &#8226; unique() and match() are now faster on character vectors where\n      all elements are in the global CHARSXP cache and have unmarked\n      encoding (ASCII).  Thanks to Matthew Dowle for suggesting\n      improvements to the way the hash code is generated in unique.c.\n\n    &#8226; The enquote() utility, in use internally, is exported now.\n\n    &#8226; .C() and .Fortran() now map non-zero return values (other than\n      NA_LOGICAL) for logical vectors to TRUE: it has been an implicit\n      assumption that they are treated as true.\n\n    &#8226; The print() methods for &quot;glm&quot; and &quot;lm&quot; objects now insert\n      linebreaks in long calls in the same way that the print() methods\n      for &quot;summary.[g]lm&quot; objects have long done.  This does change the\n      layout of the examples for a number of packages, e.g. MASS.\n      (PR#14250)\n\n    &#8226; constrOptim() can now be used with method &quot;SANN&quot;.  (PR#14245)\n\n      It gains an argument hessian to be passed to optim(), which\n      allows all the ... arguments to be intended for f() and grad().\n      (PR#14071)\n\n    &#8226; curve() now allows expr to be an object of mode &quot;expression&quot; as\n      well as &quot;call&quot; and &quot;function&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; The &quot;POSIX[cl]t&quot; methods for Axis() have been replaced by a\n      single method for &quot;POSIXt&quot;.\n\n      There are no longer separate plot() methods for &quot;POSIX[cl]t&quot; and\n      &quot;Date&quot;: the default method has been able to handle those classes\n      for a long time.  This _inter alia_ allows a single date-time\n      object to be supplied, the wish of PR#14016.\n\n      The methods had a different default (&quot;&quot;) for xlab.\n\n    &#8226; Classes &quot;POSIXct&quot;, &quot;POSIXlt&quot; and &quot;difftime&quot; have generators\n      .POSIXct(), .POSIXlt() and .difftime().  Package authors are\n      advised to make use of them (they are available from R 2.11.0) to\n      proof against planned future changes to the classes.\n\n      The ordering of the classes has been changed, so &quot;POSIXt&quot; is now\n      the second class.  See the document &#8216;Updating packages for\n      changes in R 2.12.x&#8217; on &lt;URL: <A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org\">http://developer.r-project.org</A>&gt; for\n      the consequences for a handful of CRAN packages.\n\n    &#8226; The &quot;POSIXct&quot; method of as.Date() allows a timezone to be\n      specified (but still defaults to UTC).\n\n    &#8226; New list2env() utility function as an inverse of\n      as.list(&lt;environment&gt;) and for fast multi-assign() to existing\n      environment.  as.environment() is now generic and uses list2env()\n      as list method.\n\n    &#8226; There are several small changes to output which &#8216;zap&#8217; small\n      numbers, e.g. in printing quantiles of residuals in summaries\n      from &quot;lm&quot; and &quot;glm&quot; fits, and in test statisics in print.anova().\n\n    &#8226; Special names such as &quot;dim&quot;, &quot;names&quot;, etc, are now allowed as\n      slot names of S4 classes, with &quot;class&quot; the only remaining\n      exception.\n\n    &#8226; File .Renviron can have architecture-specific versions such as\n      .Renviron.i386 on systems with sub-architectures.\n\n    &#8226; installed.packages() has a new argument subarch to filter on\n      sub-architecture.\n\n    &#8226; The summary() method for packageStatus() now has a separate\n      print() method.\n\n    &#8226; The default summary() method returns an object inheriting from\n      class &quot;summaryDefault&quot; which has a separate print() method that\n      calls zapsmall() for numeric/complex values.\n\n    &#8226; The startup message now includes the platform and if used,\n      sub-architecture: this is useful where different\n      (sub-)architectures run on the same OS.\n\n    &#8226; The getGraphicsEvent() mechanism now allows multiple windows to\n      return graphics events, through the new functions\n      setGraphicsEventHandlers(), setGraphicsEventEnv(), and\n      getGraphicsEventEnv().  (Currently implemented in the windows()\n      and X11() devices.)\n\n    &#8226; tools::texi2dvi() gains an index argument, mainly for use by R\n      CMD Rd2pdf.\n\n      It avoids the use of texindy by texinfo's texi2dvi &gt;= 1.157,\n      since that does not emulate 'makeindex' well enough to avoid\n      problems with special characters (such as (, {, !) in indices.\n\n    &#8226; The ability of readLines() and scan() to re-encode inputs to\n      marked UTF-8 strings on Windows since R 2.7.0 is extended to\n      non-UTF-8 locales on other OSes.\n\n    &#8226; scan() gains a fileEncoding argument to match read.table().\n\n    &#8226; points() and lines() gain &quot;table&quot; methods to match plot().  (Wish\n      of PR#10472.)\n\n    &#8226; Sys.chmod() allows argument mode to be a vector, recycled along\n      paths.\n\n    &#8226; There are |, &amp; and xor() methods for classes &quot;octmode&quot; and\n      &quot;hexmode&quot;, which work bitwise.\n\n    &#8226; Environment variables R_DVIPSCMD, R_LATEXCMD, R_MAKEINDEXCMD,\n      R_PDFLATEXCMD are no longer used nor set in an R session.  (With\n      the move to tools::texi2dvi(), the conventional environment\n      variables LATEX, MAKEINDEX and PDFLATEX will be used.\n      options(&quot;dvipscmd&quot;) defaults to the value of DVIPS, then to\n      &quot;dvips&quot;.)\n\n    &#8226; New function isatty() to see if terminal connections are\n      redirected.\n\n    &#8226; summaryRprof() returns the sampling interval in component\n      sample.interval and only returns in by.self data for functions\n      with non-zero self times.\n\n    &#8226; print(x) and str(x) now indicate if an empty list x is named.\n\n    &#8226; install.packages() and remove.packages() with lib unspecified and\n      multiple libraries in .libPaths() inform the user of the library\n      location used with a message rather than a warning.\n\n    &#8226; There is limited support for multiple compressed streams on a\n      file: all of [bgx]zfile() allow streams to be appended to an\n      existing file, but bzfile() reads only the first stream.\n\n    &#8226; Function person() in package utils now uses a given/family scheme\n      in preference to first/middle/last, is vectorized to handle an\n      arbitrary number of persons, and gains a role argument to specify\n      person roles using a controlled vocabulary (the MARC relator\n      terms).\n\n    &#8226; Package utils adds a new &quot;bibentry&quot; class for representing and\n      manipulating bibliographic information in enhanced BibTeX style,\n      unifying and enhancing the previously existing mechanisms.\n\n    &#8226; A bibstyle() function has been added to the tools package with\n      default JSS style for rendering &quot;bibentry&quot; objects, and a\n      mechanism for registering other rendering styles.\n\n    &#8226; Several aspects of the display of text help are now customizable\n      using the new Rd2txt_options() function.\n      options(&quot;help_text_width&quot;) is no longer used.\n\n    &#8226; Added \\href tag to the Rd format, to allow hyperlinks to URLs\n      without displaying the full URL.\n\n    &#8226; Added \\newcommand and \\renewcommand tags to the Rd format, to\n      allow user-defined macros.\n\n    &#8226; New toRd() generic in the tools package to convert objects to\n      fragments of Rd code, and added &quot;fragment&quot; argument to Rd2txt(),\n      Rd2HTML(), and Rd2latex() to support it.\n\n    &#8226; Directory R_HOME/share/texmf now follows the TDS conventions, so\n      can be set as a texmf tree (&#8216;root directory&#8217; in MiKTeX parlance).\n\n    &#8226; S3 generic functions now use correct S4 inheritance when\n      dispatching on an S4 object.  See ?Methods, section on &#8220;Methods\n      for S3 Generic Functions&#8221; for recommendations and details.\n\n    &#8226; format.pval() gains a ... argument to pass arguments such as\n      nsmall to format().  (Wish of PR#9574)\n\n    &#8226; legend() supports title.adj.  (Wish of PR#13415)\n\n    &#8226; Added support for subsetting &quot;raster&quot; objects, plus assigning to\n      a subset, conversion to a matrix (of colour strings), and\n      comparisons (== and !=).\n\n    &#8226; Added a new parseLatex() function (and related functions\n      deparseLatex() and latexToUtf8()) to support conversion of\n      bibliographic entries for display in R.\n\n    &#8226; Text rendering of \\itemize in help uses a Unicode bullet in UTF-8\n      and most single-byte Windows locales.\n\n    &#8226; Added support for polygons with holes to the graphics engine.\n      This is implemented for the pdf(), postscript(),\n      x11(type=&quot;cairo&quot;), windows(), and quartz() devices (and\n      associated raster formats), but not for x11(type=&quot;Xlib&quot;) or\n      xfig() or pictex().  The user-level interface is the polypath()\n      function in graphics and grid.path() in grid.\n\n    &#8226; File NEWS is now generated at installation with a slightly\n      different format: it will be in UTF-8 on platforms using UTF-8,\n      and otherwise in ASCII.  There is also a PDF version, NEWS.pdf,\n      installed at the top-level of the R distribution.\n\n    &#8226; kmeans(x, 1) now works.  Further, kmeans now returns between and\n      total sum of squares.\n\n    &#8226; arrayInd() and which() gain an argument useNames.  For arrayInd,\n      the default is now false, for speed reasons.\n\n    &#8226; As is done for closures, the default print method for the formula\n      class now displays the associated environment if it is not the\n      global environment.\n\n    &#8226; A new facility has been added for inserting code into a package\n      without re-installing it, to facilitate testing changes which can\n      be selectively added and backed out.  See ?insertSource.\n\n    &#8226; New function readRenviron to (re-)read files in the format of\n      ~/.Renviron and Renviron.site.\n\n    &#8226; require() will now return FALSE (and not fail) if loading the\n      package or one of its dependencies fails.\n\n    &#8226; aperm() now allows argument perm to be a character vector when\n      the array has named dimnames (as the results of table() calls\n      do).  Similarly, array() allows MARGIN to be a character vector.\n      (Based on suggestions of Michael Lachmann.)\n\n    &#8226; Package utils now exports and documents functions\n      aspell_package_Rd_files() and aspell_package_vignettes() for\n      spell checking package Rd files and vignettes using Aspell,\n      Ispell or Hunspell.\n\n    &#8226; Package news can now be given in Rd format, and news() prefers\n      these inst/NEWS.Rd files to old-style plain text NEWS or\n      inst/NEWS files.\n\n    &#8226; New simple function packageVersion().\n\n    &#8226; The PCRE library has been updated to version 8.10.\n\n    &#8226; The standard Unix-alike terminal interface declares its name to\n      readline as 'R', so that can be used for conditional sections in\n      ~/.inputrc files.\n\n    &#8226; &#8216;Writing R Extensions&#8217; now stresses that the standard sections in\n      .Rd files (other than \\alias, \\keyword and \\note) are intended to\n      be unique, and the conversion tools now drop duplicates with a\n      warning.\n\n      The .Rd conversion tools also warn about an unrecognized type in\n      a \\docType section.\n\n    &#8226; ecdf() objects now have a quantile() method.\n\n    &#8226; format() methods for date-time objects now attempt to make use of\n      a &quot;tzone&quot; attribute with &quot;%Z&quot; and &quot;%z&quot; formats, but it is not\n      always possible.  (Wish of PR#14358.)\n\n    &#8226; tools::texi2dvi(file, clean = TRUE) now works in more cases (e.g.\n      where emulation is used and when file is not in the current\n      directory).\n\n    &#8226; New function droplevels() to remove unused factor levels.\n\n    &#8226; system(command, intern = TRUE) now gives an error on a Unix-alike\n      (as well as on Windows) if command cannot be run.  It reports a\n      non-success exit status from running command as a warning.\n\n      On a Unix-alike an attempt is made to return the actual exit\n      status of the command in system(intern = FALSE): previously this\n      had been system-dependent but on POSIX-compliant systems the\n      value return was 256 times the status.\n\n    &#8226; system() has a new argument ignore.stdout which can be used to\n      (portably) ignore standard output.\n\n    &#8226; system(intern = TRUE) and pipe() connections are guaranteed to be\n      avaliable on all builds of R.\n\n    &#8226; Sys.which() has been altered to return &quot;&quot; if the command is not\n      found (even on Solaris).\n\n    &#8226; A facility for defining reference-based S4 classes (in the OOP\n      style of Java, C++, etc.) has been added experimentally to\n      package methods; see ?ReferenceClasses.\n\n    &#8226; The predict method for &quot;loess&quot; fits gains an na.action argument\n      which defaults to na.pass rather than the previous default of\n      na.omit.\n\n      Predictions from &quot;loess&quot; fits are now named from the row names of\n      newdata.\n\n    &#8226; Parsing errors detected during Sweave() processing will now be\n      reported referencing their original location in the source file.\n\n    &#8226; New adjustcolor() utility, e.g., for simple translucent color\n      schemes.\n\n    &#8226; qr() now has a trivial lm method with a simple (fast) validity\n      check.\n\n    &#8226; An experimental new programming model has been added to package\n      methods for reference (OOP-style) classes and methods.  See\n      ?ReferenceClasses.\n\n    &#8226; bzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.6 (bug-fix release).\n      --with-system-bzlib now requires at least version 1.0.6.\n\n    &#8226; R now provides jss.cls and jss.bst (the class and bib style file\n      for the Journal of Statistical Software) as well as RJournal.bib\n      and Rnews.bib, and R CMD ensures that the .bst and .bib files are\n      found by BibTeX.\n\n    &#8226; Functions using the TAR environment variable no longer quote the\n      value when making system calls.  This allows values such as tar\n      --force-local, but does require additional quotes in, e.g., TAR =\n      &quot;'/path with spaces/mytar'&quot;.\n\n  DEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT:\n\n    &#8226; Supplying the parser with a character string containing both\n      octal/hex and Unicode escapes is now an error.\n\n    &#8226; File extension .C for C++ code files in packages is now defunct.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check no longer supports configuration files containing\n      Perl configuration variables: use the environment variables\n      documented in &#8216;R Internals&#8217; instead.\n\n    &#8226; The save argument of require() now defaults to FALSE and save =\n      TRUE is now deprecated.  (This facility is very rarely actually\n      used, and was superseded by the Depends field of the DESCRIPTION\n      file long ago.)\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check --no-latex is deprecated in favour of --no-manual.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Sd2Rd is formally deprecated and will be removed in R\n      2.13.0.\n\n  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; install.packages() has a new argument libs_only to optionally\n      pass --libs-only to R CMD INSTALL and works analogously for\n      Windows binary installs (to add support for 64- or 32-bit\n      Windows).\n\n    &#8226; When sub-architectures are in use, the installed architectures\n      are recorded in the Archs field of the DESCRIPTION file.  There\n      is a new default filter, &quot;subarch&quot;, in available.packages() to\n      make use of this.\n\n      Code is compiled in a copy of the src directory when a package is\n      installed for more than one sub-architecture: this avoid problems\n      with cleaning the sources between building sub-architectures.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD INSTALL --libs-only no longer overrides the setting of\n      locking, so a previous version of the package will be restored\n      unless --no-lock is specified.\n\n  UTILITIES:\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Rprof|build|check are now based on R rather than Perl\n      scripts.  The only remaining Perl scripts are the deprecated R\n      CMD Sd2Rd and install-info.pl (used only if install-info is not\n      found) as well as some maintainer-mode-only scripts.\n\n      *NB:* because these have been completely rewritten, users should\n      not expect undocumented details of previous implementations to\n      have been duplicated.\n\n      R CMD no longer manipulates the environment variables PERL5LIB\n      and PERLLIB.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD check has a new argument --extra-arch to confine tests to\n      those needed to check an additional sub-architecture.\n\n      Its check for &#8220;Subdirectory 'inst' contains no files&#8221; is more\n      thorough: it looks for files, and warns if there are only empty\n      directories.\n\n      Environment variables such as R_LIBS and those used for\n      customization can be set for the duration of checking _via_ a\n      file ~/.R/check.Renviron (in the format used by .Renviron, and\n      with sub-architecture specific versions such as\n      ~/.R/check.Renviron.i386 taking precedence).\n\n      There are new options --multiarch to check the package under all\n      of the installed sub-architectures and --no-multiarch to confine\n      checking to the sub-architecture under which check is invoked.\n      If neither option is supplied, a test is done of installed\n      sub-architectures and all those which can be run on the current\n      OS are used.\n\n      Unless multiple sub-architectures are selected, the install done\n      by check for testing purposes is only of the current\n      sub-architecture (_via_ R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch).\n\n      It will skip the check for non-ascii characters in code or data\n      if the environment variables _R_CHECK_ASCII_CODE_ or\n      _R_CHECK_ASCII_DATA_ are respectively set to FALSE.  (Suggestion\n      of Vince Carey.)\n\n    &#8226; R CMD build no longer creates an INDEX file (R CMD INSTALL does\n      so), and --force removes (rather than overwrites) an existing\n      INDEX file.\n\n      It supports a file ~/.R/build.Renviron analogously to check.\n\n      It now runs build-time \\Sexpr expressions in help files.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Rd2dvi makes use of tools::texi2dvi() to process the\n      package manual.  It is now implemented entirely in R (rather than\n      partially as a shell script).\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Rprof now uses utils::summaryRprof() rather than Perl.  It\n      has new arguments to select one of the tables and to limit the\n      number of entries printed.\n\n    &#8226; R CMD Sweave now runs R with --vanilla so the environment setting\n      of R_LIBS will always be used.\n\n  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:\n\n    &#8226; lang5() and lang6() (in addition to pre-existing lang[1-4]())\n      convenience functions for easier construction of eval() calls.\n      If you have your own definition, do wrap it inside #ifndef lang5\n      .... #endif to keep it working with old and new R.\n\n    &#8226; Header R.h now includes only the C headers it itself needs, hence\n      no longer includes errno.h.  (This helps avoid problems when it\n      is included from C++ source files.)\n\n    &#8226; Headers Rinternals.h and R_ext/Print.h include the C++ versions\n      of stdio.h and stdarg.h respectively if included from a C++\n      source file.\n\n  INSTALLATION:\n\n    &#8226; A C99 compiler is now required, and more C99 language features\n      will be used in the R sources.\n\n    &#8226; Tcl/Tk &gt;= 8.4 is now required (increased from 8.3).\n\n    &#8226; System functions access, chdir and getcwd are now essential to\n      configure R.  (In practice they have been required for some\n      time.)\n\n    &#8226; make check compares the output of the examples from several of\n      the base packages to reference output rather than the previous\n      output (if any).  Expect some differences due to differences in\n      floating-point computations between platforms.\n\n    &#8226; File NEWS is no longer in the sources, but generated as part of\n      the installation.  The primary source for changes is now\n      doc/NEWS.Rd.\n\n    &#8226; The popen system call is now required to build R.  This ensures\n      the availability of system(intern = TRUE), pipe() connections and\n      printing from postscript().\n\n    &#8226; The pkg-config file libR.pc now also works when R is installed\n      using a sub-architecture.\n\n    &#8226; R has always required a BLAS that conforms to IE60559 arithmetic,\n      but after discovery of more real-world problems caused by a BLAS\n      that did not, this is tested more thoroughly in this version.\n\n  BUG FIXES:\n\n    &#8226; Calls to selectMethod() by default no longer cache inherited\n      methods.  This could previously corrupt methods used by as().\n\n    &#8226; The densities of non-central chi-squared are now more accurate in\n      some cases in the extreme tails, e.g. dchisq(2000, 2, 1000), as a\n      series expansion was truncated too early.  (PR#14105)\n\n    &#8226; pt() is more accurate in the left tail for ncp large, e.g.\n      pt(-1000, 3, 200).  (PR#14069)\n\n    &#8226; The default C function (R_binary) for binary ops now sets the S4\n      bit in the result if either argument is an S4 object.  (PR#13209)\n\n    &#8226; source(echo=TRUE) failed to echo comments that followed the last\n      statement in a file.\n\n    &#8226; S4 classes that contained one of &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;array&quot; or &quot;ts&quot; and\n      also another class now accept superclass objects in new().  Also\n      fixes failure to call validObject() for these classes.\n\n    &#8226; Conditional inheritance defined by argument test in\n      methods::setIs() will no longer be used in S4 method selection\n      (caching these methods could give incorrect results).  See\n      ?setIs.\n\n    &#8226; The signature of an implicit generic is now used by setGeneric()\n      when that does not use a definition nor explicitly set a\n      signature.\n\n    &#8226; A bug in callNextMethod() for some examples with &quot;...&quot; in the\n      arguments has been fixed.  See file\n      src/library/methods/tests/nextWithDots.R in the sources.\n\n    &#8226; match(x, table) (and hence %in%) now treat &quot;POSIXlt&quot; consistently\n      with, e.g., &quot;POSIXct&quot;.\n\n    &#8226; Built-in code dealing with environments (get(), assign(),\n      parent.env(), is.environment() and others) now behave\n      consistently to recognize S4 subclasses; is.name() also\n      recognizes subclasses.\n\n    &#8226; The abs.tol control parameter to nlminb() now defaults to 0.0 to\n      avoid false declarations of convergence in objective functions\n      that may go negative.\n\n    &#8226; The standard Unix-alike termination dialog to ask whether to save\n      the workspace takes a EOF response as n to avoid problems with a\n      damaged terminal connection.  (PR#14332)\n\n    &#8226; Added warn.unused argument to hist.default() to allow suppression\n      of spurious warnings about graphical parameters used with\n      plot=FALSE.  (PR#14341)\n\n    &#8226; predict.lm(), summary.lm(), and indeed lm() itself had issues\n      with residual DF in zero-weighted cases (the latter two only in\n      connection with empty models). (Thanks to Bill Dunlap for\n      spotting the predict() case.)\n\n    &#8226; aperm() treated resize = NA as resize = TRUE.\n\n    &#8226; constrOptim() now has an improved convergence criterion, notably\n      for cases where the minimum was (very close to) zero; further,\n      other tweaks inspired from code proposals by Ravi Varadhan.\n\n    &#8226; Rendering of S3 and S4 methods in man pages has been corrected\n      and made consistent across output formats.\n\n    &#8226; Simple markup is now allowed in \\title sections in .Rd files.\n\n    &#8226; The behaviour of as.logical() on factors (to use the levels) was\n      lost in R 2.6.0 and has been restored.\n\n    &#8226; prompt() did not backquote some default arguments in the \\usage\n      section.  (Reported by Claudia Beleites.)\n\n    &#8226; writeBin() disallows attempts to write 2GB or more in a single\n      call. (PR#14362)\n\n    &#8226; new() and getClass() will now work if Class is a subclass of\n      &quot;classRepresentation&quot; and should also be faster in typical calls.\n\n    &#8226; The summary() method for data frames makes a better job of names\n      containing characters invalid in the current locale.\n\n    &#8226; [[ sub-assignment for factors could create an invalid factor\n      (reported by Bill Dunlap).\n\n    &#8226; Negate(f) would not evaluate argument f until first use of\n      returned function (reported by Olaf Mersmann).\n\n    &#8226; quietly=FALSE is now also an optional argument of library(), and\n      consequently, quietly is now propagated also for loading\n      dependent packages, e.g., in require(*, quietly=TRUE).\n\n    &#8226; If the loop variable in a for loop was deleted, it would be\n      recreated as a global variable.  (Reported by Radford Neal; the\n      fix includes his optimizations as well.)\n\n    &#8226; Task callbacks could report the wrong expression when the task\n      involved parsing new code. (PR#14368)\n\n    &#8226; getNamespaceVersion() failed; this was an accidental change in\n      2.11.0. (PR#14374)\n\n    &#8226; identical() returned FALSE for external pointer objects even when\n      the pointer addresses were the same.\n\n    &#8226; L$<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">a at x</A>[] &lt;- val did not duplicate in a case it should have.\n\n    &#8226; tempfile() now always gives a random file name (even if the\n      directory is specified) when called directly after startup and\n      before the R RNG had been used.  (PR#14381)\n\n    &#8226; quantile(type=6) behaved inconsistently.  (PR#14383)\n\n    &#8226; backSpline(.) behaved incorrectly when the knot sequence was\n      decreasing.  (PR#14386)\n\n    &#8226; The reference BLAS included in R was assuming that 0*x and x*0\n      were always zero (whereas they could be NA or NaN in IEC 60559\n      arithmetic).  This was seen in results from tcrossprod, and for\n      example that log(0) %*% 0 gave 0.\n\n    &#8226; The calculation of whether text was completely outside the device\n      region (in which case, you draw nothing) was wrong for screen\n      devices (which have [0, 0] at top-left).  The symptom was (long)\n      text disappearing when resizing a screen window (to make it\n      smaller).  (PR#14391)\n\n    &#8226; model.frame(drop.unused.levels = TRUE) did not take into account\n      NA values of factors when deciding to drop levels. (PR#14393)\n\n    &#8226; library.dynam.unload required an absolute path for libpath.\n      (PR#14385)\n\n      Both library() and loadNamespace() now record absolute paths for\n      use by searchpaths() and getNamespaceInfo(ns, &quot;path&quot;).\n\n    &#8226; The self-starting model NLSstClosestX failed if some deviation\n      was exactly zero.  (PR#14384)\n\n    &#8226; X11(type = &quot;cairo&quot;) (and other devices such as png using\n      cairographics) and which use Pango font selection now work around\n      a bug in Pango when very small fonts (those with sizes between 0\n      and 1 in Pango's internal units) are requested.  (PR#14369)\n\n    &#8226; Added workaround for the font problem with X11(type = &quot;cairo&quot;)\n      and similar on Mac OS X whereby italic and bold styles were\n      interchanged.  (PR#13463 amongst many other reports.)\n\n    &#8226; source(chdir = TRUE) failed to reset the working directory if it\n      could not be determined - that is now an error.\n\n    &#8226; Fix for crash of example(rasterImage) on x11(type=&quot;Xlib&quot;).\n\n    &#8226; Force Quartz to bring the on-screen display up-to-date\n      immediately before the snapshot is taken by grid.cap() in the\n      Cocoa implementation. (PR#14260)\n\n    &#8226; model.frame had an unstated 500 byte limit on variable names.\n      (Example reported by Terry Therneau.)\n\n    &#8226; The 256-byte limit on names is now documented.\n\n    &#8226; Subassignment by [, [[ or $ on an expression object with value\n      NULL coerced the object to a list.\n\n\n--\nPeter Dalgaard\nCenter for Statistics, Copenhagen Business School\nSolbjerg Plads 3, 2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark\nPhone: (+45)38153501\nEmail: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">pd.mes at cbs.dk</A>  Priv: <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">PDalgd at gmail.com</A>\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000528.html\">R 2.12.0 scheduled for October 15\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000530.html\">R 2.12.1 scheduled for December 16 \n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#529\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#529\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#529\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#529\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is an update release, which fixes a number of mostly minor issues. The most annoying one was probably the problem with format.POSIXlt causing C stack overflow on long date vectors. See the full list of changes below.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.1.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.1.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n      For the R Core Team\n\n      Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = ac9746b4845ae866661f51cfc99262f5\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 15600c9a568cbfcb72ea074f2bc5bfb3\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 32e5abe211dc0a7d13758d576ba20c01\nMD5 (ONEWS) = a8c985af5ad5e9c7e0a9f502d07baeb4\nMD5 (OONEWS) = 4f004de59e24a52d0f500063b4603bcb\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = 7421108ade3e9223263394b9bbe277ce\nMD5 (README) = 433182754c05c2cf7a04ad0da474a1d0\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = f2ccf22f3e20ebaa86f8ee5cc6b0f655\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.11.1.tar.gz) = 7421108ade3e9223263394b9bbe277ce\n\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL checks if dependent packages are available early on\n        in the installation of source packages, thereby giving clearer\n        error messages.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL --build now names the file in the format used\n        for Mac OS X binary files on that platform.\n\n    o   BIC() in package stats4 now also works with multiple fitted models,\n        analogously to AIC().\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   Use of file extension .C for C++ code in packages is now\n        deprecated: it has caused problems for some 'make's on\n        case-insensitive file systems (although it currently works\n        with the recommended toolkits).\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   Command 'gnutar' is preferred to 'tar' when configure sets\n        TAR.  This is needed on Mac OS 10.6, where the default tar,\n        bsdtar 2.6.2, has been reported to produce archives with\n        illegal extensions to tar (according to the POSIX standard).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   The C function mkCharLenCE now no longer reads past 'len' bytes\n        (unlikely to be a problem except in user code). (PR#14246)\n\n    o   On systems without any default LD_LIBRARY_PATH (not even\n        /usr/local/lib), [DY]LIB_LIBRARY_PATH is now set without a\n        trailing colon.  (PR#13637)\n\n    o   More efficient utf8ToInt() on long multi-byte strings with\n        many multi-byte characters.  (PR#14262)\n\n    o   aggregate.ts() gave platform-depedent results due to rounding\n        error for ndeltat != 1.\n\n    o   package.skeleton() sometimes failed to fix filenames for .R or\n        .Rd files to start with an alphanumeric.  (PR#14253)\n        It also failed when only an S4 class without any methods was\n        defined.  (PR#14280)\n\n    o   splinefun(*, method = &quot;monoH.FC&quot;)  was not quite monotone in rare\n        cases.  (PR#14215)\n\n    o   Rhttpd no longer crashes due to SIGPIPE when the client closes\n        the connection prematurely.  (PR#14266)\n\n    o   format.POSIXlt() could cause a stack overflow and crash when used on\n        very long vectors.  (PR#14267)\n\n    o   Rd2latex() incorrectly escaped special characters in \\usage sections.\n\n    o   mcnemar.test() could alter the levels (dropping unused levels)\n        if passed 'x' and 'y' as factors (reported by Greg Snow).\n\n    o   Rd2pdf sometimes needed a further pdflatex pass to get\n        hyperlinked pages correct.\n\n    o   interaction() produced malformed results when levels were\n        duplicated, causing segfaults in split().\n\n    o   cut(d, breaks = &lt;n&gt;)  now also works for &quot;Date&quot; or &quot;POSIXt&quot;\n        argument d.  (PR#14288)\n\n    o   memDecompress() could decompress incompletely rare xz-compressed\n        input due to incorrect documentation of xz utils.  (Report\n        and patch from Olaf Mersmann.)\n\n    o   The S4 initialize() methods for &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, and &quot;ts&quot; have\n        been fixed to call validObject(). (PR#14284)\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL now behaves the same way with or without\n        --no-multiarch on platforms with only one installed\n        architecture.  (It used to clean the src directory without\n        --no-multiarch.)\n\n    o   [&lt;-.data.frame was not quite careful enough in assigning (and\n        potentially deleting) columns right-to-left. (PR#14263)\n\n    o   rbeta(n, a,b) no longer occasionally returns NaN for a &gt;&gt; 1 &gt; b.\n        (PR#14291)\n\n    o   pnorm(x, log.p = TRUE) could return NaN not -Inf for x near\n        (minus for lower.tail=TRUE) the largest representable number.\n\n    o   Compressed data files *.(txt|tab|csv).(gz|bz2|xz) were not\n        recognized for the list of data topics and hence for packages\n        using LazyData.  (PR#14273)\n\n    o   textConnection() did an unnecessary translation on strings in\n        a foreign encoding (e.g. UTF-8 strings on Windows) and so was\n        slower than it could have been on very long input strings.\n        (PR#14286)\n        \n    o   tools::Rd2txt() did not render poorly written Rd files\n        consistently with other renderers.\n\n    o   na.action() did not extract the 'na.action' component as\n        duplicated, causing segfaults in split().\n\n    o   cut(d, breaks = &lt;n&gt;)  now also works for &quot;Date&quot; or &quot;POSIXt&quot;\n        argument d.

(PR#14273)\n\n    o   textConnection() did an unnecessary translation on strings in\n        a foreign encoding (e.g. UTF-8 strings on Windows) and so was\n        slower than it could have been on very long input strings.\n        (PR#14286)\n        \n    o   tools::Rd2txt() did not render poorly written Rd files\n        consistently with other renderers.\n\n    o   na.action() did not extract the 'na.action' component as\n        documented.\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000520.html\">R 2.11.1 Scheduled for May 31\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000522.html\">The R Journal, Vol.2 Issue 1 \n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#521\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#521\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#521\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#521\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This is a development\nrelease which contains a number of new features.\n\nAlso, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list\nof changes below.\n\nNOTE: The build platform has been changed for this release. Please watch out extra carefully for anomalies.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.0.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.0.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n       For the R Core Team\n\n       Peter Dalgaard\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nMD5 (AUTHORS) = ac9746b4845ae866661f51cfc99262f5\nMD5 (COPYING) = eb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a\nMD5 (COPYING.LIB) = a6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343\nMD5 (FAQ) = 5b653442bedab476a4eff7468192fb5f\nMD5 (INSTALL) = 70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331\nMD5 (NEWS) = 59017734fb8474f98f994c7a5a27f9fb\nMD5 (ONEWS) = a8c985af5ad5e9c7e0a9f502d07baeb4\nMD5 (OONEWS) = 4f004de59e24a52d0f500063b4603bcb\nMD5 (R-latest.tar.gz) = c6c1e866299f533617750889c729bfb3\nMD5 (README) = 433182754c05c2cf7a04ad0da474a1d0\nMD5 (RESOURCES) = 020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da\nMD5 (THANKS) = f2ccf22f3e20ebaa86f8ee5cc6b0f655\nMD5 (R-2/R-2.11.0.tar.gz) = c6c1e866299f533617750889c729bfb3\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.11.0\n\n\nSIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o   Packages must have been installed under R &gt;= 2.10.0, as the\n        current help system is the only one now supported.\n\n    o   A port to 64-bit Windows is now available as well as binary\n        package repositiories: see the 'R Administration and\n        Installation Manual'.\n\n    o   Argument matching for primitive functions is now done in the\n        same way as for interpreted functions except for the deliberate\n        exceptions\n\n            call switch .C .Fortran .Call .External\n\n        all of which use positional matching for their first argument,\n        and also some internal-use-only primitives.\n\n    o   The default device for command-line R at the console on Mac OS X\n        is now quartz() and not X11().\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   The 'open' modes for connections are now interpreted more\n        consistently.  open = &quot;r&quot; is now equivalent to open = &quot;rt&quot; for\n        all connections.  The default open = &quot;&quot; now means &quot;rt&quot; for all\n        connections except the compressed file connections gzfile(),\n        bzfile() and xzfile() for which it means &quot;rb&quot;.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL now uses the internal untar() in package utils:\n        this ensures that all platforms can install bzip2- and\n        xz-compressed tarballs.  In case this causes problems (as it\n        has on some Windows file systems when run from Cygwin tools)\n        it can be overridden by the environment variable\n        R_INSTALL_TAR: setting this to a modern external tar program\n        will speed up unpacking of large (tens of Mb or more)\n        tarballs.\n\n    o   help(try.all.packages = TRUE) is much faster (although the\n        time taken by the OS to find all the packages the first time\n        it is used can dominate the time).\n\n    o   R CMD check has a new option '--timings' to record\n        per-example timings in file &lt;pkg&gt;.Rcheck/&lt;pkg&gt;-Ex.timings.\n\n    o   The TRE library has been updated to version 0.8.0 (minor bugfixes).\n\n    o   grep[l], [g]sub and [g]regexpr now work in bytes in an 8-bit\n        locales if there is no marked UTF-8 input string: this will be\n        somewhat faster, and for [g]sub() give the result in the\n        native encoding rather than in UTF-8 (which returns to the\n        behaviour prior to R 2.10.0).\n\n    o   A new argument 'skipCalls' has been added to browser() so that\n        it can report the original context when called by other\n        debugging functions.\n\n    o   More validity checking of UTF-8 and MBCS strings is done by\n        agrep() and the regular-expression matching functions.\n\n    o   The undocumented restriction on gregexpr() to length(text) &gt; 0\n        has been removed.\n\n    o   Package tcltk now sends strings to Tcl in UTF-8: this means\n        that strings with a marked UTF-8 encoding are supported in\n        non-UTF-8 locales.\n\n    o   The graphics engine now supports rendering of raster (bitmap)\n        images, though not all graphics devices can provide (full)\n        support.  Packages providing graphics devices (e.g., Cairo,\n        RSvgDevice, cairoDevice) will need to be reinstalled.\n\n        There is also support in the graphics engine for capturing\n        raster images from graphics devices (again not supported\n        on all graphics devices).\n\n    o   R CMD check now also checks if the package and namespace can\n        be unloaded: this provides a check of the .Last.lib() and\n        .onUnload() hook functions (unless --install=fake).\n\n    o   prop.table(x) now accepts a one-dimensional table for x.\n\n    o   A new function vapply() has been added, based on a suggestion\n        from Bill Dunlap.  It requires that a template for the\n        function value be specified, and uses it to determine the\n        output type and to check for consistency in the function\n        values.\n\n    o   The main HTML help page now links to a reformatted copy of\n        this NEWS file. (Suggested by Henrik Bengtsson.)  Package\n        index files link to the package DESCRIPTION and NEWS files and\n        a list of demos when using dynamic help.\n\n    o   The [ method for class &quot;AsIs&quot; allows the next method to change\n        the underlying class.  (Wish of Jens Oehlschl&#228;gel.)\n\n    o   write.csv[2] no longer allow 'append' to be changed: as ever,\n        direct calls to write.table() give more flexibility as well as\n        more room for error.\n\n    o   The index page for HTML help for a package now collapses\n        multiple signatures for S4 methods into a single entry.\n\n    o   The use of '.required' by require() and detach() has been\n        replaced by '.Depends' which is set from the 'Depends' field\n        of a package (even in packages with name spaces).  By default\n        detach() prevents such dependencies from being detached: this\n        can be overridden by the argument 'force'.\n\n    o   bquote() has been extended to work on function definitions\n        (wish of PR#14031).\n\n    o   detach() when applied to an object other than a package\n        returns the environment that has been detached, to parallel\n        attach().\n\n    o   readline() in non-interactive use returns &quot;&quot; and does not\n        attempt to read from the 'terminal'.\n\n    o   New function file_ext() in package 'tools'.\n\n    o   xtfrm() is now primitive and internally generic, as this allows\n        S4 methods to be set on it without name-space scoping issues.\n\n        There are now &quot;AsIs&quot; and &quot;difftime&quot; methods, and the default\n        method uses unclass(x) if is.numeric(x) is true (which will be\n        faster but relies on is.numeric() having been set correctly\n        for the class).\n\n    o   is.numeric(x) is now false for a &quot;difftime&quot; object\n        (multiplication and division make no sense for such objects).\n\n    o   The default method of weighted.mean(x, w) coerces 'w' to be\n        numeric (aka double); previously only integer weights were\n        coerced.  Zero weights are handled specially so an infinite\n        value with zero weight does not force an NaN result.\n\n        There is now a &quot;difftime&quot; method.\n\n    o   bug.report() now has 'package' and 'lib.loc' arguments to\n        generate bug reports about packages.  When this is used, it\n        looks for a BugReports field in the package DESCRIPTION file,\n        which will be assumed to be a URL at which to submit the\n        report, and otherwise generates an email to the package\n        maintainer.  (Suggested by Barry Rowlingson.)\n\n    o   quantile() now has a method for the date-time class &quot;POSIXt&quot;,\n        and types 1 and 3 (which never interpolate) work for Dates and\n        ordered factors.\n\n    o   length(&lt;POSIXlt&gt;)  now returns the length of the corresponding\n        abstract timedate-vector rather than always 9 (the length of the\n        underlying list structure).  (Wish of PR#14073 and PR#10507.)\n\n    o   The readline completion backend no longer sorts possible\n        completions alphabetically (e.g., function argument names) if\n        R was built with readline &gt;= 6.\n\n    o   select.list() gains a 'graphics' argument to allow Windows/Mac\n        users to choose the text interface.  This changes the\n        behaviour of new.packages(ask=TRUE) to be like\n        update.packages(ask=TRUE) on those platforms in using a text\n        menu: use ask=&quot;graphics&quot; for a graphical menu.\n\n    o   New function chooseBioCmirror() to set the &quot;BioC_mirror&quot; option.\n\n    o   The R grammar prevents using the argument 'name' in signatures\n        of S4 methods for '$' and '$&lt;-', since they will always be\n        called with a character string value for 'name'.  The implicit\n        S4 generic functions have been changed to reflect this:\n        packages which included 'name' in the signature of their\n        methods need to be updated and re-installed.\n\n    o   The handling of the 'method' argument of glm() has been\n        refined following suggestions by Ioannis Kosmidis and Heather\n        Turner.\n\n    o   str() gains a new argument 'list.len' with default 99, limiting the\n        number of list() items (per level), thanks to suggestions from\n        David Winsenius.\n\n    o   Having formal arguments of an S4 method in a different order\n        from the generic is now an error (the warning having been\n        ignored by some package maintainers for a long time).\n\n    o   New functions enc2native() and enc2utf8() convert character\n        vectors with possibly marked encodings to the current locale and\n        UTF-8 respectively.\n\n    o   Unrecognized escapes and embedded nuls in character strings are\n        now an error, not just a warning.  Thus option &quot;warnEscapes&quot;\n        is no longer needed.  rawToChar() now removes trailing nuls\n        silently, but other embedded nuls become errors.\n\n    o   Informational messages about masked objects displayed when a\n        package is attached are now more compact, using strwrap()\n        instead of one object per line.\n\n    o   print.rle() gains argument 'prefix'.\n\n    o   download.file() gains a &quot;curl&quot; method, mainly for use on\n        platforms which have 'curl' but not 'wget', but also for some\n        hard-to-access URLs.\n\n    o   In Rd, \\eqn and \\deqn will render in HTML (and convert to text)\n        upper- and lower-case Greek letters (entered as \\alpha ...),\n        \\ldots, \\dots, \\ge and \\le.\n\n    o   utf8ToInt() and intToUtf8() now map NA inputs to NA outputs.\n\n    o   file() has a new argument 'raw' which may help if it is used\n        with something other than a regular file, e.g. a character device.\n\n    o   New function strtoi(), a wrapper for the C function strtol.\n\n    o   as.octmode() and as.hexmode() now allow inputs of length other\n        than one.\n\n        The format() and print() methods for &quot;octmode&quot; now preserve\n        names and dimensions (as those for &quot;hexmode&quot; did).\n\n        The format() methods for classes &quot;octmode&quot; and &quot;hexmode&quot; gain\n        a 'width' argument.\n\n    o   seq.int() returns an integer result in some further cases\n        where seq() does, e.g. seq.int(1L, 9L, by = 2L).\n\n    o   Added \\subsection{}{} macro to Rd syntax, for subsections\n        within sections.\n\n    o   n-dimensional arrays with dimension names can now be indexed\n        by an n-column character matrix. The indices are matched\n        against the dimension names.  NA indices are propagated to the\n        result.  Unmatched values and &quot;&quot; are not allowed and result in\n        an error.\n\n    o   interaction(drop=TRUE) uses less memory (related to PR#14121).\n\n    o   summary() methods have been added to the &quot;srcref&quot; and\n        &quot;srcfile&quot; classes, and various encoding issues have been\n        cleaned up.\n\n    o   If option &quot;checkPackageLicense&quot; is set to TRUE (not currently\n        the default), users will be asked to agree to\n        non-known-to-be-FOSS package licences at first use.\n\n    o   Checking setAs(a,b) methods only gives a message instead of a\n        warning, when one of a or b is unknown.\n\n    o   New function norm() to compute a matrix norm.\n        norm() and also backsolve() and sample() have implicit S4 generics.\n\n    o   Renviron.site and Rprofile.site can have architecture-specific\n        versions on systems with sub-architectures.\n\n    o   R CMD check now (by default) also checks Rd files for\n        auto-generated content in need of editing, and missing argument\n        descriptions.\n\n    o   aggregate() gains a formula method thanks to a contribution by\n        Arni Magnusson.  The data frame method now allows summary\n        functions to return arbitrarily many values.\n\n    o   path.expand() now propagates NA values rather than converting them\n        to &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o   file.show() now disallows NA values for file names, headers, and\n        pager.\n\n    o   The 'fuzz' used by seq() and seq.int() has been reduced from\n        1e-7 to 1e-10, which should be ample for the double-precision\n        calculations used in R.  It ensures that the fuzz never comes\n        into play with sequences of integers (wish of PR#14169).\n\n    o   The default value of RSiteSearch(restrict=) has been changed\n        to include vignettes but to exclude R-help.  The R-help\n        archives available have been split, with a new option of\n        &quot;Rhelp10&quot; for those from 2010.\n\n    o   New function rasterImage() in the 'graphics' package for drawing\n        raster images.\n\n    o   stats:::extractAIC.coxph() now omits aliased terms when computing\n        the degrees of freedom (suggestion of Terry Therneau).\n\n    o   cor() and cov() now test for misuse with non-numeric\n        arguments, such as the non-bug report PR#14207.\n\n    o   pchisq(ncp =, log.p = TRUE) is more accurate for probabilities\n        near one.  E.g. pchisq(80, 4, ncp=1, log.p=TRUE).  (Maybe what\n        was meant in PR#14126.)\n\n    o   maintainer() has been added, to give convenient access to the\n        name of the maintainer of a package (contributed by David\n        Scott).\n\n    o   sample() and sample.int() allow zero items to be sampled from\n        a zero-length input.  sample.int() gains a default value\n        'size=n' to be more similar to sample().\n\n    o   switch() returned NULL on error (not previously documented on\n        the help page): it now does so invisibly, analogously to\n        if-without-else.\n\n        It is now primitive: this means that EXPR is always matched to\n        the first argument and there is no danger of partial matching\n        to later named arguments.\n\n    o   Primitive functions UseMethod(), attr(), attr&lt;-(), on.exit(),\n        retracemem() and substitute() now use standard argument\n        matching (rather than positional matching).  This means that\n        all multi-argument primitives which are not internal now use\n        standard argument matching except where positional matching is\n        desirable (as for switch(), call(), .C() ...).\n\n    o   All the one-argument primitives now check that any name\n        supplied for their first argument is a partial match to the\n        argument name as documented on the help page: this also\n        applies to replacement functions of two arguments.\n\n    o   base::which() uses a new .Internal function when arr.ind is\n        FALSE resulting in a 10x speedup.  Thanks to Patrick Aboyoun\n        for implementation suggestions.\n\n    o   Help conversion to text now uses the first part of \\enc{}{}\n        markup if it is representable in the current output encoding.\n        On the other hand, conversion to LaTeX with the default\n        outputEncoding = &quot;ASCII&quot; uses the second part.\n\n    o   A new class &quot;listOfMethods&quot; has been introduced to represent\n        the methods in a methods table, to replace the deprecated\n        class &quot;MethodsList&quot;.\n\n    o   any() and all() return early if possible.  This may speed up\n        operations on long vectors.\n\n    o   strptime() now accepts &quot;%z&quot; (for the offset from UTC in the\n        RFC822 format of +/-hhmm).\n\n    o   The PCRE library has been updated to version 8.02, a bug-fix\n        release which also updates tables to Unicode 5.02.\n\n    o   Functions which may use a graphical select.list() (including\n        menu() and install.packages()) now check on a Unix-alike that\n        Tk can be started (and not just\n        capabilities(&quot;tcltk&quot;) &amp;&amp; capabilities(&quot;X11&quot;)).\n\n    o   The parser no longer marks strings containing octal or hex\n        escapes as being in UTF-8 when entered in a UTF-8 locale.\n\n    o   On platforms with cairo but not Pango (notably Mac OS X) the\n        initial default X11() type is set to &quot;Xlib&quot;: this avoids\n        several problems with font selection when done by cairo rather\n        than Pango (at least on Mac OS X).\n\n    o   New arrayInd() such that which(x, arr.ind = TRUE) for an array\n        'x' is now equivalent to arrayInd(which(x), dim(x), dimnames(x)).\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   Bundles of packages are defunct.\n\n    o   stats::clearNames() is defunct: use unname().\n\n    o   Basic regular expressions are defunct, and strsplit(), grep(),\n        grepl(), sub(), gsub(), regexpr() and gregexpr() no longer\n        have an 'extended' argument.\n\n    o   methods::trySilent() is defunct.\n\n    o   index.search() (which was deprecated in 2.10.0) is no longer\n        exported and has a different argument list.\n\n    o   Use of multiple arguments to return() is now defunct.\n\n    o   The use of UseMethod() with more than two arguments is now defunct.\n\n    o   In the 'methods' package, the MethodsList metadata objects which\n        had been superseded by hash tables (environments) since R\n        2.8.0 are being phased out.  Objects of this class are no\n        longer assigned or used as metadata by the package.\n\n        getMethods() is now deprecated, with its internal use replaced\n        by findMethods() and other changes.  Creating objects from the\n        MethodsList class is also deprecated.\n\n    o   Parsing strings containing both octal/hex and Unicode escapes\n        now gives a warning and will become an error in R 2.12.0.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   UTF-8 is now used for the reference manual and package\n        manuals.  This requires LaTeX '2005/12/01' or later.\n\n    o   configure looks for a POSIX compliant tr, Solaris's\n        /usr/ucb/tr having been found to cause Rdiff to malfunction.\n\n    o   configure is now generated with autoconf-2.65, which works\n        better on recent systems and on Mac OS X.\n\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION\n\n    o   Characters in R source which are not translatable to the\n        current locale are now handled more tolerantly:  these will be\n        converted to hex codes with a warning.  Such characters are\n        only really portable if they appear in comments.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL now tests that the installed package can be loaded\n        (and backs out the installation if it cannot): this can be\n        suppressed by --no-test-load.  This avoids installing/updating\n        a package that cannot be used: common causes of failures to\n        load are missing/incompatible external software and\n        missing/broken dependent packages.\n\n    o   Package installation on Windows for a package with a src\n        directory now checks if a DLL is created unless there is a\n        src/Makefile.win file: this helps catch broken installations\n        where the toolchain has not reported problems in building the DLL.\n        (Note: this can be any DLL, not just one named &lt;pkg-name&gt;.dll.)\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Using with(), eval() etc with a list with some unnamed\n        elements now works. (PR#14035)\n\n    o   The &quot;quick&quot; dispatch of S4 methods for primitive functions was\n        not happening, forcing a search each time.  (Dispatch for\n        closures was not affected.)  A side effect is that default\n        values for arguments in a method that do not have defaults in\n        the generic will now be ignored.\n\n    o   Trying to dispatch S4 methods for primitives during the search\n        for inherited methods slows that search down and potentially\n        could cause an infinite recursion.  An internal switch was\n        added to turn off all such methods from\n        findInheritedMethods().\n\n    o   R framework installation (on Mac OS X) would not work properly\n        if a rogue Resources directory was present at the top level.\n        Such a non-symlink will now be renamed to Resources.old (and\n        anything previously named Resources.old removed) as part of\n        the framework installation process.\n\n    o   The checks for conforming S4 method arguments could fail when\n        the signature of the generic function omitted some of the\n        formal arguments (in addition to ...).  Arguments omitted from\n        the method definition but conforming (per the documentation)\n        should now be ignored (treated as &quot;ANY&quot;) in dispatching.\n\n    o   The computations for S4 method evaluation when '...' was in the\n        signature could fail, treating '...' as an ordinary symbol.\n        This has been fixed, for the known cases.\n\n    o   Various ar() fitting methods have more protection for singular\n        fits.\n\n    o   callNextMethod now works again with the drop= argument in `[`\n\n    o   parse() and parse_Rd() miscounted columns when multibyte UTF-8\n        characters were present.\n\n    o   Formatting of help pages has had minor improvements: extra\n        blank lines have been removed from the text format, and empty\n        package labels removed from HTML.\n\n    o   cor(A, B) where A has n x 1 and B a 1-dimensional array\n        segfaulted or gave an internal error.\n        (The case cor(B, A) was PR#7116.)\n\n    o   cut.POSIXt() applied to a start value after the DST transition\n        on a DST-change day could give the wrong time for 'breaks' in units\n        of days or longer.  (PR#14208)\n\n    o   do_par() UNPROTECTed too early (PR#14214)\n\n    o   subassignment x[[....]] &lt;- y didn't check for a zero-length\n        right hand side, and inserted rubbish value. (PR#14217)\n\n    o   fisher.test() no longer gives a P-value *very* slightly &gt; 1,\n        in some borderline cases.\n\n    o   Internal function matchArgs no longer modifies the general\n        purpose bits of the SEXPs that make up the formals list of R\n        functions.  This fixes an invalid error message that would\n        occur when a garbage collection triggered a second call to\n        matchArgs for the same function via a finalizer.\n\n    o   gsub() in 2.10.x could fail from stack overflow for extremely\n        long strings due to temporary data being allocated on the\n        stack.  Also, gsub() with fixed=TRUE is in some circumstances\n        considerably faster.\n\n    o   Several primitives, including attributes(), attr&lt;-()\n        interactive(), nargs() and proc.time(), did not check that\n        they were called with the correct number of arguments.\n\n    o   A potential race condition in list.files() when other processes\n        are operating on the directory has been fixed; the code now\n        dynamically allocates memory for file listings in a single\n        pass instead of making an initial count pass.\n\n    o   mean(x, trim=, na.rm = FALSE) failed to return NA if 'x'\n        contained missing values.  (Reported by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o   Extreme tail behavior of, pbeta() {and hence pf()}, e.g.,\n        pbeta(x, 3, 2200, lower.tail=FALSE, log.p=TRUE) now returns\n        finite values instead of jumping to -Inf too early (PR#14230).\n\n    o   parse(text=x) misbehaved for objects 'x' that were not coerced\n        internally to character, notably symbols.  (Reported to\n        R-devel by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o   The internal C function 'coerceSymbol' now handles coercion to\n        character, and warns if coercion fails (rather than silently\n        returning NULL).  This allows a name to be given where a\n        character vector is required in functions which coerce\n        internally.\n\n    o   The interpretation by strptime() of %c was non-standard (not\n        that it is ever advisable to use locale- and system-specific\n        input formats).\n\n    o   capabilities(&quot;X11&quot;) now works the same way on Mac OS X as on\n        other platforms (and as documented: it was always true for R\n        built with --with-aqua, as the CRAN builds are).\n\n    o   The X11() device with cairo but not Pango (notably Mac OS X)\n        now checks validity of text strings in UTF-8 locales (since\n        Pango does but cairo it seems does not).\n\n    o   read.fwf() misread multi-line records when n was specified.\n        (PR#14241)\n\n    o   all.equal(*, tolerance = e) passes the numeric tolerance also to\n        the comparison of the attributes.\n\n    o   pgamma(0,0), a boundary case, now returns 0, its limit from the\n        left, rather than the limit from the right.\n\n    o   Issuing POST requests to the internal web server could stall\n        the request under certain circumstances.\n\n    o   gzcon( &lt;textConnection&gt; ), an error, no longer damages the\n        connection (in a way to have it seg.fault). (PR#14237)\n\n    o   All the results from hist() now use the nominal 'breaks' not\n        those adjusted by the numeric 'fuzz&quot;: in recent versions the\n        nominal 'breaks' were reported but the 'density' referred to\n        the intervals used in the calculation -- which mattered very\n        slightly for one of the extreme bins.  (Based on a report by\n        Martin Becker.)\n\n    o   If xy[z].coords (used internally by many graphics functions) are\n        given a list as 'x', they now check that the list has suitable\n        names and give a more informative error message.

These are\n        intended for special purposes (e.g. building a database\n        of help pages without fully installing all packages).\n\n    o   The documented line-length limit of 4095 bytes when reading\n        from the console now also applies also to parse(file=&quot;&quot;)\n        (which previously had a limit of around 1024 bytes).\n\n    o   A Bioconductor mirror can be set for use by setRepositories()\n        via the option &quot;BioC_mirror&quot;, e.g. the European mirror can be\n        selected by\n        options(BioC_mirror=&quot;<A HREF=\"http://bioconductor.statistik.tu-dortmund.de&quot;\">http://bioconductor.statistik.tu-dortmund.de&quot;</A>)\n\n    o   Double-clicking in a tk_select.list() list box now selects the\n        item and closes the list box (as happens on the Windows\n        select.list() widget).\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   configure will be able to find a usable libtiff in some rare\n        circumstances where it did not previously (where libtiff\n        needed to be linked explicitly against -ljpeg).\n\n    o   Making refman.pdf works around a problem with the indexing\n        with hyperref 6.79d and later.\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   The 'extended' argument is deprecated in strsplit(), grep(),\n        grepl(), sub(), gsub(), regexpr() and gregexpr() (not just the\n        value extended = FALSE) and will be removed in R 2.11.0.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   trigamma(x) and other psigamma(x, n) calls are now accurate for\n        very large abs(x). (PR#14020)\n\n    o   [g]sub(perl=FALSE, fixed=FALSE) could use excessive stack space\n        when used with a very long vector containing some non-ASCII\n        strings.\n\n    o   The default method of weighted.mean(na.rm = TRUE) did not omit\n        weights for NA observations in 2.10.0.  (PR#14032)\n\n    o   [g]regexpr(pattern, fixed = TRUE) returned match positions in\n        bytes (not characters) in an MBCS locale if 'pattern' was a\n        single byte.\n\n        [g]sub(fixed = TRUE) with a single-byte pattern could\n        conceivably have matched part of a multibyte character in a\n        non-UTF-8 MBCS.\n\n    o   findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() would sometimes fail if the\n        specified file was not in the current directory.\n\n    o   Package tcltk's demo(tkdensity) was broken in 2.9.0 when demo()\n        was changed to set par(ask = TRUE).\n\n    o   gsub() with backrefs could fail on extremely long strings\n        (hundreds of thousands of characters) due to integer overflow\n        in a length calculation.\n\n    o   abline(*, untf=TRUE) now uses a better x-grid in log-scale, e.g.,\n        for plot(c(1,300), c(1,300), log=&quot;xy&quot;) ; abline(4,1, untf=TRUE).\n\n    o   detach/unloadNamespace() arrange to flush the package's\n        lazyload cache of R objects once the package/namespace is no\n        longer needed.\n\n    o   There have been small fixes to the rendering of help,\n        e.g. \\command is now rendered verbatim (so e.g. -- is not\n        interpreted, PR#14045).\n\n        Also, there are many small changes to help files where the new\n        converters were not rendering them in the same way as before.\n\n    o   available.packages() would fail when run on a repository\n        with no packages meeting the filtering conditions. (PR#14042)\n\n    o   rep(x, times, each = 2) gave invalid results when the 'times'\n        argument is a vector longer than 'x'.  Reported by Bill Dunlap.\n\n    o   An error when unloadNamespace() attempted to run the .onUnload()\n        function gave an error in the reporting function and so was\n        not reported properly.\n\n    o   Text help rendering did not handle very long input lines\n        properly.\n\n    o   promptMethods() generated signature documentation improperly.\n\n    o   pgamma(x, a, lower.tail=FALSE) and qgamma(..) are now\n        considerably more accurate in some regions for very small 'a'.\n        qgamma() now correctly returns 0 instead of NaN in similar\n        extreme cases, and qgamma() no longer warns in the case of\n        small 'a', see (PR#12324).\n\n    o   unname() now also removes names from a zero length vector.\n\n    o   Printing results from ls.str() no longer evaluates unevaluated\n        calls.\n\n    o   complete.cases() failed on a 0-column data frame argument.\n        (Underlies PR#14066.)\n\n        It could return nonsensical results if no input determined the\n        number of cases (seen in the no-segfault tests).\n\n    o   An error in nls() with a long formula could cause a segfault.\n        (PR#14059)\n\n    o   qchisq(p, df, ncp, lower.tail = FALSE) with ncp &gt;= 80 was\n        inaccurate for small p (as the help page said): it is now\n        less inaccurate. (In part, PR#13999.)\n\n        For ncp less than but close to 80, pchisq() and qchisq() are\n        more accurate for probablilities very close to 1 (a series\n        expansion was truncated slightly too early).\n\n        pchisq(x, df, ncp) can no longer return values just larger\n        than one for large values of ncp.\n\n    o   intToUtf8() could fail when asked to produce 10Mb or more\n        strings, something it was never intended to do: unfortunately\n        Windows crashed R (other OSes reported a lack of resources).\n        (PR#14068)\n\n    o   chisq.test() could fail when given argument 'x' or 'y' which\n        deparsed to more than one line.  (Reported by Laurent Gauthier.)\n\n    o   S4 methods are uncached whenever the name space containing\n        them is unloaded (by unloadNamespace() as well as by\n        detach(unload = TRUE)).\n\n    o   The internal record-keeping by dyn.load/dyn.unload was\n        incomplete, which could crash R if a DLL that registered\n        .External routines had earlier been unloaded.\n\n    o   bessel[JY](x, nu) with nu a negative integer (a singular case)\n        is now correct, analogously to besselI(), see PR#13556, below.\n\n    o   tools::file_path_as_absolute() doubled the file separator when\n        applied to a file such as &quot;/vmunix&quot; or (on Windows) &quot;d:/afile&quot;\n        in a directory for which getwd() would return a path with a\n        trailing separator (largely cosmetic, as reasonable file\n        systems handle such a path correctly).  (Perhaps what was\n        meant by PR#14078.)\n\n    o   unsplit(drop = TRUE) applied to a data frame failed to pass\n        'drop' to the computation of row names. (PR#14084)\n\n    o   The &quot;difftime&quot; method of mean() ignored its 'na.rm' argument.\n\n    o   tcltk::tk_select.list() is now more likely to remove the\n        widget immediately after selection is complete.\n\n    o   Adding/subtracting a &quot;difftime&quot; object to/from a &quot;POSIXt&quot; or\n        &quot;Date&quot; object works again (it was broken by the addition of\n        Ops.difftime).\n\n    o   Conversion to latex of an Rd file with no aliases failed.\n\n    o   wilcox.test(*, conf.int=TRUE) has achieved.level corrected and, for\n        exact=FALSE, now gives an 'estimate' which does not depend on the\n        alternative used.\n\n    o   help.search() failed when the package argument was specified.\n        (PR#14113)\n\n    o   switch(EXPR = &quot;A&quot;)  now returns NULL, as switch(1) {which used to\n        signal an error}.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

Forgot to change the Subject: line...)\n\nI've rolled up R-2.10.0.tar.gz some hours ago. This is a development\nrelease which contains a number of new features, notably a brand new\nHTML based dynamic help system.\n\nAlso, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed. See the full list\nof changes below.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.10.0.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.10.0.tar.gz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\n\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\n        For the R Core Team\n\n        Peter Dalgaard\n\n\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\n70447ae7f2c35233d3065b004aa4f331  INSTALL\n433182754c05c2cf7a04ad0da474a1d0  README\n4f004de59e24a52d0f500063b4603bcb  OONEWS\nff4bd9073ef440b1eb43b1428ce96872  ONEWS\nb80eafe743ef130e129c6d004793492f  NEWS\n7abcbbc7480df75a11a00bb09783db90  THANKS\n070cca21d9f8a6af15f992edb47a24d5  AUTHORS\na6f89e2100d9b6cdffcea4f398e37343  COPYING.LIB\neb723b61539feef013de476e68b5c50a  COPYING\n020479f381d5f9038dcb18708997f5da  RESOURCES\n9ec5df24a0d6ecb04a9817275b825027  FAQ\n4486934883b1dbcd5400135e22b26a75  R-2.10.0.tar.gz\n4486934883b1dbcd5400135e22b26a75  R-latest.tar.gz\n\n\nThis is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.10.0\n\n\nSIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o   Package help is now converted from Rd by the R-based converters\n        that were first introduced in 2.9.0.  This means\n\n        - Packages that were installed by R-devel after 2009-08-09\n          should not be used with earlier versions of R, and most\n          aspects of package help (including the runnable examples)\n          will be missing if they are so used.\n\n        - Text, HTML and latex help and examples for packages\n          installed under the new system are converted on-demand from\n          stored parsed Rd files.  (Conversions stored in packages\n          installed under R &lt; 2.10.0 are used if no parsed Rd files\n          are found.  It is recommended that such packages be\n          re-installed.)\n\n\n    o   HTML help is now generated dynamically using an HTTP server\n        running in the R process and listening on the loopback\n        interface.\n\n        - Those worried about security implications of such a server\n          can disable it by setting the environment variable\n          R_DISABLE_HTTPD to a non-empty value.  This disables\n          help.start() and HTML help (so text help is shown instead).\n\n        - The Java/Javascript search engine has been replaced by an\n          HTML interface to help.search().  help.start() no longer has\n          an argument 'searchEngine' as it is no longer needed.\n\n        - The HTML help can now locate cross-references of the form\n          \\link[pkg]{foo} and \\link[pkg:foo]{bar} where 'foo' is an\n          alias in the package, rather than the documented (basename\n          of a) filename (since the documentation has been much\n          ignored).\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   polygon(), pdf() and postscript() now have a parameter\n        'fillOddEven' (default FALSE), which controls the mode used for\n        polygon fills of self-intersecting shapes.\n\n    o   New debugonce() function; further,\n        getOption(&quot;deparse.max.lines&quot;) is now observed when debugging,\n        from a code suggestion by John Brzustowski.  (PR#13647/8)\n\n    o   plot() methods for &quot;stepfun&quot; and hence &quot;ecdf&quot; no longer plot\n        points by default for n &gt;= 1000.\n\n    o   [g]sub(*, perl=TRUE) now also supports '\\E' in order to *end*\n        \\U and \\L case changes, thanks to a patch from Bill Dunlap.\n\n    o   factor(), `levels&lt;-`(), etc, now ensure that the resulting factor\n        levels are unique (as was always the implied intention).  Factors\n        with duplicated levels are still constructible by low-level means,\n        but are now declared illegal.\n\n    o   New print() (S3) method for class &quot;function&quot;, also used for\n        auto-printing.  Further, .Primitive functions now print and\n        auto-print identically.  The new method is based on code\n        suggestions by Romain Fran&#231;ois.\n\n    o   The print() and toLatex() methods for class &quot;sessionInfo&quot; now\n        show the locale in a nicer format and have arguments to\n        suppress locale information.\n\n    o   In addition to previously only round(), there are other 'Math'\n        group (S3) methods for 'difftime', such as floor(), signif(),\n        abs(), etc.\n\n    o   For completeness, old.packages() and available.packages() allow\n        'type' to be specified (you could always specify 'available'\n        or 'contriburl').\n\n    o   available.packages() by default only returns information on\n        the latest versions of packages whose version requirements are\n        satisified by the currently running R.\n\n    o   tools::write_PACKAGES() has a new argument 'latestOnly', which\n        defaults to TRUE when only the latest versions in the\n        repository will be listed in the index.\n\n    o   getOption() has a new argument 'default' that is returned if\n        the specified option is not set. This simplifies querying a\n        value and checking whether it is NULL or not.\n\n    o   parse() now warns if the requested encoding is not supported.\n\n    o   The &quot;table&quot; method of as.data.frame() gains a 'stringsAsFactors'\n        argument to allow the classifying factors to be returned as\n        character vectors rather than the default factor type.\n\n    o   If model.frame.default() encounters a character variable where\n        'xlev' indicates a factor, it now converts the variable to a\n        factor (with a warning).\n\n    o   curve() now returns a list containing the points that were drawn.\n\n    o   spineplot() now accepts axes = FALSE, for consistency with\n        other functions called by plot.factor().\n\n    o   The Kendall and Spearman methods of cor.test() can optionally\n        use continuity correction when not computing exact p-values.\n        (The Kendall case is the wish of PR#13691.)\n\n    o   R now keeps track of line numbers during execution for\n        code sourced with options(keep.source = TRUE).  The source\n        reference is displayed by debugging functions such as traceback(),\n        browser(), recover(), and dump.frames(), and is stored as an\n        attribute on each element returned by sys.calls(). [Experimental]\n\n    o   More functions now have an implicit (S4) generic definition.\n\n    o   quantile.default() now disallows factors (wish of PR#13631)\n        and its help documents what numeric-like properties its input\n        need to have to work correctly.\n\n    o   weighted.mean() is now generic and has &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;POSIXct&quot; and\n        &quot;POSIXlt&quot; methods.\n\n    o   Naming subscripts (e.g. x[i=1, j=2]) in data.frame methods for\n        [ and [[ now gives a warning.  (Names are ignored in the\n        default method, but could have odd semantics for other\n        methods, and do for the data.frame ones.)\n\n    o   as.data.frame() has an &quot;aovproj&quot; method.  (Wish of PR#13505)\n\n    o   as.character(x) for numeric x no longer produces strings such as\n        &quot;0.30&quot;, i.e., with trailing zeros.  This change also renders\n        levels construction in factor() more consistent.\n\n    o   codocClasses(), which checks consistency of the documentation of\n        S4 class slots, now does so in considerably more cases.  The\n        documentation of inherited slots (from superclasses) is now\n        optional.  This affects 'R CMD check &lt;pkg&gt;' when the package\n        defines S4 classes.\n\n    o   codoc() now also checks S4 methods for code/documentation\n        mismatches.\n\n    o   for(), while(), and repeat() loops  now always return NULL as\n        their (invisible) value.  This change was needed to address a\n        reference counting bug without creating performance penalties\n        for some common use cases.\n\n    o   The print() method for ls.str() results now obeys an optional\n        'digits' argument.\n\n    o   The 'method' argument of glm() now allows user-contributed methods.\n\n    o   More general reorder.default() replaces functionality of\n        reorder.factor() and reorder.character().\n\n    o   The function aspell() has been added to provide an interface to\n        the Aspell spell-checker.\n\n    o   Filters RdTextFilter() and SweaveTeXFilter() have been added\n        to the tools package to provide support for aspell() or other\n        spell checkers.\n\n    o   xtabs() with the new option 'sparse = TRUE' now returns a sparse\n        Matrix, using package 'Matrix'.\n\n    o   contr.sum() etc gain an argument 'sparse' which allows sparse\n        matrices to be returned.\n\n        contrasts() also gains a 'sparse' argument which it passes to the\n        actual contrast function if that has a formal argument 'sparse'.\n\n        'contrasts(f, .) &lt;- val' now also works when 'val' is a sparse\n        Matrix.  It is planned that model.matrix() will work with such\n        factors 'f' in the future.\n\n    o   readNEWS() will recognize a UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM) in the\n        NEWS file. However, it is safer to use only ASCII code there\n        because not all editors recognize BOMs.\n\n    o   New utility function inheritedSlotNames() for S4 class programming.\n\n    o   tabulate() now allows NAs to pass through (and be ignored).\n\n    o   If debug() is called on an S3 generic function then all methods\n        are debugged as well.\n\n    o   Outlier symbols drawn by boxplot() now obey the 'outlwd'\n        argument.  Reported by Jurgen Kluge.\n\n    o   svd(x) and eigen(x) now behave analogously to qr(x) in\n        accepting logical matrices x.\n\n    o   File NEWS is now in UTF-8, and has a BOM (often invisible) on\n        the first line, and Emacs local variables set for UTF-8 at the\n        end.  RShowDoc(&quot;NEWS&quot;) should display this correctly, given\n        suitable fonts.\n\n    o   terms.formula(simplify = TRUE) now does not deparse the LHS and\n        so preserves non-standard responses such as `a: b` (requested\n        by Sundar Dorai-Raj).\n\n    o   New function news() for building and querying R or package news\n        information.\n\n    o   z^n for integer n and complex z is more accurate now if\n        |n| &lt;= 65536.\n\n    o   factor(NULL) now returns the same as factor(character(0))\n        instead of an error, and table(NULL) consequently does\n        analogously.\n\n    o   as.data.frame.vector() (and its copies) is slightly faster\n        by avoiding a copy if there are no names (following a\n        suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).\n\n    o   writeLines(), writeBin() and writeChar() have a new argument\n        'useBytes'.  If false, character strings with marked encodings\n        are translated to the current locale (as before) but if true\n        they are written byte-by-byte.\n\n    o   iconv() has a new argument 'mark' which can be used (by\n        experts) to suppress the declaration of encodings.\n\n    o   DESCRIPTION 'LinkingTo' specs are now recognized as installation\n        dependencies, and included in package management computations.\n\n    o   Standardized DESCRIPTION 'License' specs are now available for\n        package management computations.\n\n    o   &quot;\\uxxxx&quot; and &quot;\\Uxxxxxxxx&quot; escapes can now be parsed to a UTF-8\n        encoded string even in non-UTF-8 locales (this has been\n        implemented on Windows since R 2.7.0).  The semantics have\n        been changed slightly: a string containing such escapes is\n        always stored in UTF-8 (and hence is suitable for portably\n        including Unicode text in packages).\n\n    o   New as.raw() method for &quot;tclObj&quot; objects (wish of PR#13578).\n\n    o   Rd.sty now makes a better job of setting email addresses,\n        including using a monospaced font.\n\n    o   textConnection() gains an 'encoding' argument to determine how\n        input strings with marked encodings will be handled.\n\n    o   R CMD Rd2pdf is available as a shortcut for R CMD Rd2dvi --pdf.\n\n    o   R CMD check now checks links where a package is specified\n        (\\link[pkg]{file} or \\link[pkg:file]{topic}), if the package\n        is available.  It notes if the package is not available, as in\n        many cases this is an error in the link.\n\n    o   identical() gains three logical arguments, which allow for even\n        more differentiation, notably '-0' and '0'.\n\n    o   legend() now can specify the 'border' color of filled boxes,\n        thanks to a patch from Frederic Schutz.\n\n    o   Indexing with a vector index to [[]] has now been extended to\n        all recursive types.\n\n    o   Pairlists may now be assigned as elements of lists.  (Lists\n        could always be created with pairlist elements, but [[&lt;-\n        didn't support assigning them.)\n\n    o   The parser now supports C-preprocessor-like #line directives,\n        so error messages and source references may refer to the original\n        file rather than an intermediate one.\n\n    o   New functions findLineNum() and setBreakpoint() work with the\n        source references to find the location of source lines and set\n        breakpoints (using trace()) at those lines.\n\n    o   Namespace importing is more careful about warning on masked\n        generics, thanks to a patch by Yohan Chalabi.\n\n    o   detach() now has an argument 'character.only' with the same\n        meaning as for library() or require().\n\n    o   available.packages() gains a 'filters' argument for specifying\n        the filtering operations performed on the packages found in the\n        repositories.  A new built-in 'license/FOSS' filter only\n        retains packages for which installation can proceed solely based\n        on packages which can be verified as Free or Open Source\n        Software (FOSS) employing the available license specifications.\n\n    o   In registering an S3 class by a call to setOldClass(), the data\n        part (e.g., the object type) required for the class can be\n        included as one of the superclasses in the Classes argument.\n\n    o   The argument 'f' to showMethods() can be an expression evaluating\n        to a generic function, allowing methods to be shown for\n        non-exported generics and other nonstandard cases.\n\n    o   sprintf() now supports '%o' for octal conversions.\n\n    o   New function Sys.readlink() for information about symbolic\n        links, including if a file is a symbolic link.\n\n    o   Package 'tools' has new functions checkRdaFiles() and\n        resaveRdaFiles() to report on the format of .rda/.RData data\n        files, and to re-save them in a different compressed format,\n        including choosing the most compact format available.\n\n        A new INSTALL option, --resave-data, makes use of this.\n\n    o   File ~/.R/config is used in preference to ~/.Rconfig, and\n        these are now documented in 'R Installation and Administration'.\n\n    o   Logic operations with complex numbers now work, as they were always\n        documented to, and as in S.\n\n    o   arrows() and segments() allow one of x1 or y1 to be omitted to\n        simplify the specification of vertical or horizontal lines\n        (suggestion of Tim Hesterberg).\n\n    o   approxfun() is faster by avoiding repeated NA checks (diagnosis\n        and patch by Karline Soetaert &amp; Thomas Petzoldt).\n\n    o   There are the beginnings of a Nynorsk translation by Karl Ove\n        Hufthammer.\n\n    o   stripchart() allows par 'bg' to be passed in for the\n        background colour for pch = 21 (wish of PR#13984).\n\n    o   New generic function .DollarNames() to enable class authors\n        to customize completion after the $ extractor.\n\n    o   load(), save(), dput() and dump() now open a not-yet-open\n        connection in the appropriate mode (as other functions using\n        connections directly already did).\n\n\nREGULAR EXPRESSIONS\n\n    o   A different regular expression engine is used for basic and\n        extended regexps and is also for approximate matching.  This is\n        based on the TRE library of Ville Laurikari, a modifed copy of\n        which is included in the R sources.\n\n        This is often faster, especially in a MBCS locale.\n\n        Some known differences are that it is less tolerant of invalid\n        inputs in MBCS locales, and in its interpretation of undefined\n        (extended) regexps such as &quot;^*&quot;.  Also, the interpretation of\n        ranges such as [W-z] in caseless matching is no longer to map\n        the range to lower case.\n\n        This engine may in future be used in 'literal' mode for fixed\n        = TRUE, and there is a compile-time option in src/main/grep.c\n        to do so.\n\n    o   The use of repeated boundary regexps in gsub() and gregexpr() as\n        warned about in the help page does not work in this engine (it\n        did in the previous one since 2005).\n\n    o   Extended (and basic) regexps now support same set of options as\n        for fixed = TRUE and perl = TRUE, including 'useBytes' and\n        support for UTF-8-encoded strings in non-UTF-8 locales.\n\n    o   agrep() now has full support for MBCS locales with a modest\n        speed penalty.  This enables help.search() to use approximate\n        matching character-wise rather than byte-wise.\n\n    o   [g]sub use a single-pass algorithm instead of matching twice\n        and so is usually faster.\n\n    o   The perl = TRUE versions now work correctly in a non-UTF-8 MBCS\n        locale, by translating the inputs to UTF-8.\n\n    o   useBytes = TRUE now inhibits the translation of inputs with\n        marked encodings.\n\n    o   strsplit() gains a 'useBytes' argument.\n\n    o   The algorithm used by strsplit() has been reordered to batch by\n        elements of 'split': this can be much faster for fixed = FALSE\n        (as multiple compilation of regexps is avoided).\n\n    o   The help pages, including ?regexp, have been updated and\n        should be consulted for details of the new implementations.\n\n\nHELP &amp; Rd FILE CHANGES\n\n    o   A new dynamic HTML help system is used by default, and may be\n        controlled using tools::startDynamicHelp().  With this enabled,\n        HTML help pages will be generated on request, resolving links\n        by searching through the current .libPaths().  The user\n        may set option(&quot;help.ports&quot;) to control which IP port is used\n        by the server.\n\n    o   help.start() no longer sets options(htmlhelp = TRUE) (it used\n        to on Unix but not on Windows).  Nor does it on Unix reset the\n        &quot;browser&quot; option if given an argument of that name.\n\n        Arguments 'update' and 'remote' are now available on all\n        platforms: the default is update = FALSE since the http server\n        will update the package index at first use.\n\n    o   help() has a new argument 'help_type' (with default set by the\n        option of that name) to supersede 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and\n        'chmhelp' (although for now they still work if 'help_type' is\n        unset).  There is a new type, &quot;PDF&quot; to allow offline PDF\n        (rather than PostScript).\n\n        A function offline_help_helper() will be used if this exists\n        in the workspace or further down the search path, otherwise\n        the function of that name in the 'utils' name space is used.\n\n    o   Plain text help is now used as the fallback for HTML help (as\n        it always was for Compiled HTML help on Windows).\n\n    o   It is possible to ask for static HTML pages to be prebuilt via\n        the configure option --enable-prebuilt-html.  This may be\n        useful for those who wish to make HTML help available outside\n        R, e.g. on a local web site.\n\n    o   An experimental tag \\Sexpr has been added to Rd files, to\n        evaluate expressions at build, install, or render time.\n        Currently install time and render time evaluation are\n        supported.\n\n    o   Tags \\if, \\ifelse and \\out have been added to allow\n        format-specific (or more general, using \\Sexpr) conditional\n        text in man pages.\n\n    o   The parse_Rd() parser has been made more tolerant of coding\n        errors in Rd files:  now all syntax errors are reported as\n        warnings, and an attempt is made to continue parsing.\n\n    o   parse_Rd() now has an argument 'fragment' (default FALSE) to\n        accept small fragments of Rd files (so that \\Sexpr can output\n        Rd code which is then parsed).\n\n    o   parse_Rd() now always converts its input to UTF-8.  The Rd2*\n        rendering functions have a new parameter, 'outputEncoding',\n        which controls how their output is encoded.\n\n    o   parse_Rd() no longer includes the newline as part of a\n        &quot;%&quot;-style comment.\n\n    o   There have been various bug fixes and code reorganization in\n        the Rd renderers Rd2HTML, Rd2latex, Rd2txt, and Rd2ex.\n\n        All example files are now created with either ASCII or UTF-8\n        encoding, and the encoding is only marked in the file if there\n        is any non-UTF-8 code (previously it was marked if the help\n        file had non-ASCII contents, possibly in other sections).\n\n    o   print.Rd() now adds necessary escape characters so that\n        printing and re-parsing an Rd object should produce an\n        equivalent object.\n\n    o   parse_Rd() was incorrectly handling multiple backslashes in\n        R code strings, converting 4n+3 backslashes to 2n+1 instead\n        of 2n+2.\n\n    o   parse_Rd() now recognizes the \\var tag within a quoted string\n        in R-like text.\n\n    o   parse_Rd() now treats the argument of \\command as LaTeX-like,\n        rather than verbatim.\n\n\nCOMPRESSION\n\n    o   New function untar() to list or unpack tar archives, possibly\n        compressed.  This uses either an external 'tar' command or an\n        internal implementation.\n\n    o   New function tar() to create (possibly compressed) tar archives.\n\n    o   New functions memCompress() and memDecompress() for in-memory\n        compression and decompression.\n\n    o   bzfile() has a 'compress' argument to select the amount of\n        effort put into compression when writing.\n\n    o   New function xzfile() for use with xz-compressed files.  (This\n        can also read files compressed by some versions of 'lzma'.)\n\n    o   gzfile() looks at the file header and so can now also read\n        bzip2-ed files and xz-compressed files.\n\n    o   There are the new options of save(compress = &quot;bzip2&quot;) and &quot;xz&quot;\n        to use bzip2 or xz compression (which will be slower, but can\n        give substantially smaller files).  Argument compression_level\n        gives finer control over the space/time tradeoffs.\n\n        load() can read such saves (but only as from this version of R).\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL/check and tools::writePACKAGES accept a wider\n        range of compressed tar archives.  Precisely how wide depends\n        on the capabilities of the host system's 'tar' command: they\n        almost always include .tar.bz2 archives, and with modern\n        versions of 'tar' other forms of compression such as lzma and\n        xz, and arbitrary extensions.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL has a new option --data-compress to control the\n        compression used when lazy-loading data.  New possibilities are\n        --data-compress=bzip2 which will give ca 15% better\n        compression at the expense of slower installation times, and\n        --data-compress=xz, often giving even better compression on\n        large datasets at the expense of much longer installation\n        times.  (The latter is used for the recommended packages: it is\n        particularly effective for 'survival'.)\n\n    o   file() for open = &quot;&quot;, &quot;r&quot; or &quot;rt&quot; will automagically detect\n        compressed files (from gzip, bzip2 or xz).  This means that\n        compressed files can be specified by file name (rather than\n        via a gzfile() connection) to read.table(), readlines(),\n        scan() and so on.\n\n    o   data() can handle compressed text files with extensions\n        .{txt,tab,csv}.{gz,bz2,xz} .\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   png(type=&quot;cairo1&quot;) is defunct: the value is no longer recognized.\n\n    o   tools::Rd_parse() is defunct (as this version of R uses only\n        Rd version 2).\n\n    o   Use of ~/.Rconf (which was deprecated in favour of ~/.Rconfig\n        in 2004) has finally been removed.\n\n    o   Bundles of packages are deprecated.  See 'Writing R\n        Extensions' for the steps needed to unbundle a bundle.\n\n    o   help() arguments 'offline', 'htmlhelp' and 'chmhelp' are\n        deprecated in favour of 'help_type'.\n\n    o   clearNames() ('stats') is deprecated for unname().\n\n    o   Basic regular expressions (extended = FALSE) are deprecated in\n        strsplit, grep and friends.  There is a precise POSIX standard\n        for them, but it is not what recent RE engines implement, and\n        it seems that in almost all cases package authors intended\n        fixed = TRUE when using extended = FALSE.\n\n    o   methods::trySilent() is deprecated for  try(*, silent=TRUE) or\n        - more efficiently and flexibly - something like\n        tryCatch(*, error = function(e) e).\n\n    o   index.search() is deprecated: there are no longer directories of\n        types other than 'help'.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   cairo &gt;= 1.2 is now required (1.2.0 was released in July 2006)\n        for cairo-based graphics devices (which remain optional).\n\n    o   A suitable iconv() is now required: support for configure option\n        --without-iconv has been withdrawn (it was deprecated in R 2.5.0).\n\n    o   Perl is no longer 'essential'.  R can be built without it, but\n        scripts R CMD build, check, Rprof and Sd2d require it.\n\n    o   A system 'glob' function is now essential (a working\n        Sys.glob() has been assumed since R 2.9.0 at least).\n\n    o   C99 support for MBCS is now required, and configure option\n        --disable-mbcs has been withdrawn.\n\n    o   Having a version of 'tar' capable of automagically detecting\n        compressed archives is useful for utils::untar(), and so 'gtar'\n        (a common name for GNU tar) is preferred to 'tar': set\n        environment variable TAR to specify a particular 'tar' command.\n\n\nINTERNATIONALIZATION\n\n    o   There is some makefile support for adding/updating translations\n        in packages: see po/README and 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n        There is support for the use of 'dngettext' for C-level\n        translations in packages: see 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Assigning an extra 0-length column to a data frame by\n        DF[, &quot;foo&quot;] &lt;- value now works in most cases (by filling with\n        NAs) or fails.  (It used to give a corrupt data frame.)\n\n    o   validObject() avoids an error during evaluation in the case\n        of various incorrect slot definitions.\n\n    o   n:m now returns a result of type &quot;integer&quot; in a few more\n        boundary cases.\n\n    o   The 'zap.ind' argument to printCoefmat() did not usually work as\n        other code attempted to ensure that non-zero values had a\n        non-zero representation.\n\n    o   printCoefmat() formatted groups of columns together, not just\n        the cs.ind group but also the zap.ind group and a residual\n        group.  It now formats all columns except the cs.ind group\n        separately (and zaps the zap.ind group column-by-column).  The\n        main effect will be see in the output from print.anova, as\n        this grouped SS-like columns in the zap.ind group.\n\n    o   R_ReplDLLinit() initializes the top-level jump so that some\n        embedded applications on Windows no longer crash on error.\n\n    o   identical() failed to take the encoding of character strings\n        into account, so identical byte patterns are not necessarily\n        identical strings, and similarly Latin-1 and UTF-8 versions of\n        the same string differ in byte pattern.\n\n    o   methods(f) used to warn unnecessarily for an S4 generic 'f' which\n        had been created based on an existing S3 generic.\n\n    o   The check for consistent ordering of superclasses was not\n        ignoring all conditional relations (the symptom was usually\n        spurious warnings for classes extending &quot;array&quot;).\n\n    o   Trying to assign into a raw vector with an index vector\n        containing NAs could cause a segfault.  Reported by Herv&#233; Pag&#232;s.\n\n    o   Rscript could segfault if (by user error) its filename argument\n        was missing.  Reported by Martin Morgan.\n\n    o   getAnywhere() (and functions that use it, including argument\n        completion in the console) did not handle special built-in\n        functions.  Reported by Romain Francois.\n\n    o   order() was missing a PROTECT() call and so could segfault when\n        called on character data under certain (rare) circumstances\n        involving marked non-native encodings.\n\n    o   prettyNum(z, drop0trailing=TRUE) did not work correctly when z\n        was a complex vector.  Consequently, str(z, ...)  also did\n        not.  (PR#13985)\n\n    o   'make distclean' removed too many files in etc/ if\n        builddir = srcdir.\n\n    o   R CMD replaced TEXINPUTS rather than appending to it (as\n        documented and intended).\n\n    o   help.start() no longer fails on unix when &quot;browser&quot; is a\n        function.\n\n    o   pbeta(x, *, log.p = TRUE) is sometimes more accurate, e.g., for\n        very small x.\n\n    o   Unserializing a pre-2.8 workspace containing pure ASCII character\n        objects with a LATIN1 or UTF-8 encoding would corrupt the CHARSXP\n        cache.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

PR#13789, which failed only on 32-bit systems.)\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   R CMD Rd2txt is deprecated, and will be removed in 2.10.0.\n        (It is just a wrapper for R CMD Rdconv -t txt.)\n\n    o   tools::Rd_parse() is deprecated and will be removed in 2.10.0\n        (which will use only Rd version 2).\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   parse_Rd() still did not handle source reference encodings\n        properly.\n\n    o   The C utility function PrintValue no longer attempts to print\n        attributes for CHARSXPs as those attributes are used\n        internally for the CHARSXP cache.  This fixes a segfault when\n        calling it on a CHARSXP from C code.\n\n    o   PDF graphics output was producing two instances of anything\n        drawn with the symbol font face. (Report from Baptiste Auguie.)\n\n    o   length(x) &lt;- newval and grep() could cause memory corruption.\n        (PR#13837)\n\n    o   If model.matrix() was given too large a model, it could crash\n        R. (PR#13838, fix found by Olaf Mersmann.)\n\n    o   gzcon() (used by load()) would re-open an open connection,\n        leaking a file descriptor each time. (PR#13841)\n\n    o   The checks for inconsistent inheritance reported by setClass()\n        now detect inconsistent superclasses and give better warning\n        messages.\n\n    o   print.anova() failed to recognize the column labelled\n        P(&gt;|Chi|) from a Poisson/binomial GLM anova as a p-value\n        column in order to format it appropriately (and as a\n        consequence it gave no significance stars).\n\n    o   A missing PROTECT caused rare segfaults during calls to\n        load().  (PR#13880, fix found by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o   gsub() in a non-UTF-8 locale with a marked UTF-8 input\n        could in rare circumstances overrun a buffer and so segfault.\n\n    o   R CMD Rdconv --version was not working correctly.\n\n    o   Missing PROTECTs in nlm() caused &quot;random&quot; errors. (PR#13381 by\n        Adam D.I. Kramer, analysis and suggested fix by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o   Some extreme cases of pbeta(log.p = TRUE) are more accurate\n        (finite values &lt; -700 rather than -Inf).  (PR#13786)\n\n        pbeta() now reports on more cases where the asymptotic\n        expansions lose accuracy (the underlying TOMS708 C code was\n        ignoring some of these, including the PR#13786 example).\n\n    o   new.env(hash = TRUE, size = NA) now works the way it has been\n        documented to for a long time.\n\n    o   tcltk::tk_choose.files(multi = TRUE) produces better-formatted\n        output with filenames containing spaces.  (PR#13875)\n\n    o   R CMD check --use-valgrind did not run valgrind on the package\ntests.\n\n    o   The tclvalue() and the print() and as.xxx methods for class\n        &quot;tclObj&quot; crashed R with an invalid object -- seen with an\n        object saved from an earlier session.\n\n    o   R CMD BATCH garbled options -d &lt;debugger&gt; (useful for\n        valgrind, although --debugger=valgrind always worked)\n\n    o   INSTALL with LazyData and Encoding declared in DESCRIPTION\n        might have left options(&quot;encoding&quot;) set for the rest of the\n        package installation.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

Prior\nto the conference, there will be tutorials on R (proposals for\ntutorials should be sent before 2009-11-01).\n\nINVITED LECTURES\n\nInvited speakers will include\n\n        Mark Handcock, Frank Harrell Jr, Friedrich Leisch, Michael Meyer,  \n\tRichard Stallman, Luke Tierney, Diethelm Wuertz.\n\nUSER-CONTRIBUTED SESSIONS\n\nThe sessions will be a platform to bring together R users,\ncontributors, package maintainers and developers in the S spirit that\n`users are developers'. People from different fields will show us how\nthey solve problems with R in fascinating applications.  \nThe sessions are organized by members of the program committee,\nincluding\n\n         Dirk Eddelbuettel, John Fox, Virgilio Gomez-Rubio, \n\t Richard Heiberger, Torsten Hothorn, Aaron King, Jan de Leeuw,\n         Nicholas Lewin-Koh, Andy Liaw, Uwe Ligges, Martin Maechler,\n         Katharine Mullen, Heather Turner, Ravi Varadhan, H.

The proposals should give a brief description of\nthe tutorial, including goals, detailed outline, justification why the\ntutorial is important, background knowledge required and potential\nattendees. The proposals should be sent before 2009-11-01 to useR-2010\nat R-project.org.\n\nCONFERENCE WEBPAGE\n\nA webpage offering more information is available at\n\n   <A HREF=\"http://www.R-project.org/useR-2010\">http://www.R-project.org/useR-2010</A>\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\n   2009-10-01\topen submission of abstracts \n   2009-10-01\topen registration\n   2009-11-01\ttutorial submission deadline\n   2010-03-01\tearly registration deadline\n   2010-03-01\tsubmission deadline for abstracts\n   Before 2010-03-15\tnotification of acceptance\n   2010-06-20\tregistration deadline (later registration NOT possible on site) \n   2010-07-20\ttutorials\n   2010-07-21\tconference start\n   2010-07-23\tconference end\n\nWe hope to meet you in Gaithersburg!\n\nThe organizing committee:\n         Nathan Dodder, William Guthrie, Walter Liggett, John Lu,\n         Katharine Mullen, Jonathon Phillips, Antonio Possolo, \n   \t Ravi Varadhan.\n\n</PRE>\n\n\n<!--endarticle-->\n    <HR>\n    <P><UL>\n        <!--threads-->\n\t<LI>Previous message: <A HREF=\"000505.html\">R 2.9.1 is released\n</A></li>\n\t<LI>Next message: <A HREF=\"000507.html\">R 2.9.2 Scheduled for August 24, 2009\n</A></li>\n         <LI> <B>Messages sorted by:</B> \n              <a href=\"date.html#506\">[ date ]</a>\n              <a href=\"thread.html#506\">[ thread ]</a>\n              <a href=\"subject.html#506\">[ subject ]</a>\n              <a href=\"author.html#506\">[ author ]</a>\n         </LI>\n       </UL>\n\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">More information about the R-announce\nmailing list</a><br>\n</body></html>\n",

This affects\n\tR CMD Rd2dvi and help(offline=TRUE).\n\n\tR CMD Rd2dvi now gives an explicit error message if latex (or\n\tpdflatex) fails.\n\n\tR CMD Rd2dvi gains a --no-index argument: processing some\n\tspecial characters on PDF indices gave errors which used to be\n\tignored.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n     o\tR CMD INSTALL --with-package-versions is deprecated (and\n\tsupport has always been incomplete on Windows).\n\n\tSo is install.packages(installWithVers = TRUE).\n\n     o\tRd conversion to Sd and Ssgm is now deprecated as we no longer\n\thave any means to check the results (and Sd is long obsolete).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n     o\tadd1.glm() no longer warns if applied to a binomial glm with a\n\tfactor response.\n\n     o\taggregate.data.frame() now does something sensible with a\n\tzero-column 'x' rather than failing with an obscure error\n\tmessage.  It gives an explicit error message if called with a\n\tzero-row 'x'.\n\n     o\tintegrate() now accepts integer results from f(): as documented,\n\tbut only double was accepted.\n\n     o\tcontrib.url() produced an incorrect URL for the type\n         &quot;mac.binary&quot;.\n\n     o   pairwise.wilcox.test() did not pass on the 'paired' argument\n         (caught by Matthias Kohl)\n\n     o\tbmp(), jpeg(), and png() on unix with type=&quot;cairo&quot; would segfault\n\ton closure if the output file could not be opened.\n\n     o\ttiff() on unix would not write the output file for the first page\n\twhen multiple pages were plotted.\n\n     o   str(1 + structure(1, class = &quot;test&quot;)) no longer recurses \nindefinitely.\n\n     o\tpf(x, .., ncp, lower.tail=FALSE, log=TRUE) is much more accurate\n\tfor large x now.\n\n     o\tdev2bitmap() failed in 2.8.0 if 'taa' and 'gaa' were both NA.\n\n     o\tUnder rare circumstances equality tests for character strings\n     \tcould fail to report equality in 2.8.0 in the same way as\n     \t2.7.2.  (This needed a current encoding of Latin-1 or UTF-8,\n     \tone string whose encoding was marked as that encoding and one\n     \tthat was marked as &quot;unknown&quot;.  In that circumstance the two\n     \tstrings are not actually known to be equal, but earlier\n     \tversions of R assumed that &quot;unknown&quot; meant the current\n     \tencoding, and this is done once again.)\n\n     o\tR CMD config could echo messages from GNU make if called from\n\twithin a Makefile (as e.g. package Rcpp did), especially from\n\twithin a parallel make run.\n\n     o\tRounding error could affect window(extend=TRUE) when applied\n\tto monthly series.  (PR#13272)\n\n     o\tOffline help on a Unix-alike now works even if options\n\t&quot;latexcmd&quot; and &quot;dvipscmd&quot; contain spaces\n\t(e.g. &quot;dvips -Pmy_printer&quot;).\n\n\tInformative error messages are given if running latex or dvips\n\tfail.\n\n     o\tUsing plot.lm() on a &quot;glm&quot; object since 2.7.1 with which=5\n\tcaused the Pearson rather than deviance residuals to be used\n\tin which=2 or 3 (including in the default case).  (Thanks to\n\tEffie Greathouse and Greg Snow.)\n\n\tplot.lm() did not report on omitting observations with\n\tleverage one if they also had residual exactly zero.  This was\n\tseen in example(occupationalStatus).\n\n     o\tdeparse(nlines=) no longer pads short results with blank\n\tlines. (PR#13299)\n\n     o\tlegend(xpd=) now restores 'xpd' correctly.  (PR#12756)\n\n     o\tThe &quot;formula&quot; method for lines() now works if 'subset' is\n\tsupplied and no 'data' argument (as that for points() did).\n\n     o\tSweave() now takes the defaults for the options 'pdf.version'\n\tand 'pdf.encoding' of its RweaveLatex driver from pdf.options().\n\n     o\tprettyNum(x, drop0trailing=TRUE) treated &quot;1.1e20&quot; as &quot;1.1e2&quot;\n\tand hence str() did as well, in 2.8.0 only.\n\n     o\tdchisq(x, df, ncp) no longer hangs for large x and ncp &gt; 0,\n\tand is more accurate in some cases (PR#13309).\n\n     o\tinstalled.packages(lib.loc = D, priority=&quot;NA&quot;) now also works when\n\tD contains a single package.  (PR#13332)\n\n     o\tlegend(...., merge=TRUE) now warns and has no effect in the\n\tcase where no line segments are drawn.  (PR#13340)\n\n     o \ttransform.data.frame() works better when two or more columns are\n\tadded.\n\n     o\tDeparsing argument lists with non-syntactic names (e.g. that for\n\ttransform()) now uses backticks rather than double quotes to\n\tproduce syntactically valid output.\n\n     o\tmatrix() failed to check for 0-length 'dimnames': it now\n\ttreats them as NULL (as array did).  (PR#13361)\n\n     o\t0^NA is now NA, not Inf, consistent with x^NA, x != 1.\n\n     o\tanova.mlm() did not work if T had only one row (including\n\te.g. the case M = ~1).\n\n     o\taxis.POSIXct() mislabelled for some time ranges of a few hours\n\t(reported by Martin Becker).\n\n     o\tmantelhaen.test() with 'exact=FALSE' was not respecting\n\t'alternative'. It now does one-sided tests similarly to\n\tprop.test().\n\n     o\tanova.mlm() had trouble with some designs where near-zero rows of\n\tthe tranformation matrix were not removed (caught by Nils Skutara).\n\n     o\tRd conversion was handling expressions like\n\t'\\item{foo}{see \\eqn{x}}' (with one argument to \\eqn\n\timmediately followed by a right brace) incorrectly, sometimes\n\tgiving a spurious warning about 'missing text'.\n\n     o\tR CMD INSTALL used the C locale to install the DESCRIPTION\n\tfile, and so escaped non-ASCII characters in packages with a\n\tdeclared encoding of &quot;latin1&quot; or &quot;UTF-8&quot;.  (However, the\n\tinstalled DESCRIPTION file was rarely used since the dumped\n\tmetadata are available.)\n\n     o\txspline() now respects inline par settings.\n\n\tIt and grid.xspline() now handle the special case of only two\n\tcontrol points, and splines with control points that are\n\tlocated well outside the device (e.g., a zoomed view of a\n\tlarger curve).\t(Both cases were giving the error &quot;reached\n\tMAXNUMPTS&quot;).\n\n     o\tIn setClass(&quot;C&quot;, contains=&quot;list&quot;); x &lt;- new(&quot;C&quot;, 1:3), x[2:3] now\n         remains of class &quot;C&quot;.  So does rep(x, 2) or rep.int(x, 3).\n\n     o\tmedian.default() now also works for &quot;numeric&quot;-like vectors.\n\n     o\tThe pdf() device can now handle the case where an image uses a\n\tvery large number of colours with different levels of\n\tsemi-transparency (alpha-values).  It used to segfault.\n\t(Also PR#13264.)\n\n     o\twindow() failed to apply a fuzz to 'start' or 'end' and so\n\tsometimes warned incorrectly for time series with 'freq' not a\n\tpower of two (e.g. 12 or 24).\n\n     o\tunique.default() now preserves the &quot;tzone&quot; attribute on\n\t&quot;POSIXct&quot; objects.\n\n     o\tIf all the packages had dependency lists of equal lengths,\n\toccasionally install.packages() would compute an incorrect\n\tsort order.\n\n     o\tcol(x, as.factor=TRUE) and row(x, as.factor=TRUE) would fail\n\tif x had no column (row) names.  It was documented\n\tincorrectly, and now returns a matrix factor.\n\n     o\tsetRepositories() failed if &quot;pkgType&quot; was set to\n\t&quot;mac.binary.leopard&quot;.\n\n     o\tformals&lt;-() changed the body of the function if this was a\n     \tlength-one list.\n\n     o\tbody&lt;-() failed if the function had no arguments.  It now\n\twarns if discarding elements from a 'value' of type &quot;expression&quot;.\n\n     o\tqr.coef() failed in the complex case for non-square systems.\n     \t(PR#13305)\n\n     o\tplot.dendrogram(horizontal=TRUE) did not not plot 'edgetext'\n\tat the correct locations.  (PR#13313)\n\n     o\tThe starting point for plot.acf(ci.type=&quot;ma&quot;) was lag 0 when it\n\tshould have been lag 1.  (PR#13071)\n\n     o   There was an obscure bug with srcrefs, which could put the\n         parser into a condition giving &quot;Error: bad value&quot; on any input\n\n\n-- \n    O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n   c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

(Unfortunately, those are hard to guess.)\n\n    o   by() gains a 'simplify' argument, passed to tapply().\n\n    o   capabilities() gains a new argument &quot;tiff&quot; to report if tiff()\n        is operational.\n\n    o   chol2inv() now treats &lt;numeric(1)&gt; as a [1 x 1]-matrix.\n\n    o   cov() and cor() have the option 'use = &quot;everything&quot;' as default,\n        and so does var() with its default 'na.rm = FALSE'.  This\n        returns NA instead of signalling an error for NA observations.\n        Another new option is 'use = &quot;na.or.complete&quot;' which is the default\n        for var(*, na.rm=FALSE).\n        var(double(0), na.rm= L) now returns NA instead of signalling an error,\n        for both L = TRUE or FALSE, as one consequence of these changes.\n\n    o   data.matrix() now tries harder to convert non-numeric columns,\n        via as.numeric() or as(, &quot;numeric&quot;).\n\n    o   dev.interactive() is able to recognize the standard screen\n        devices if getOption(&quot;device&quot;) is a function (as well as by name).\n\n    o   dev.new() gains a '...' argument which can be used to pass\n        named arguments which will be used if appropriate to the\n        device selected.\n\n    o   dimnames(x) &lt;- value extends 'value' if it a list and too\n        short, and 'x' is an array.  This allows constructions such as\n        dimnames(x)[[1]] &lt;- 1:3 to work whether or not 'x' already has\n        dimnames.\n\n    o   format(), formatC() and prettyNum() gain a new argument\n        'drop0trailing' which can be used to suppress trailing &quot;0&quot;s.\n\n    o   format() now works for environments; also print(env) and str(env)\n        share the same code for environments.\n\n    o   It is now possible to create and open a text-mode gzfile()\n        connection by explicitly using e.g. open=&quot;rt&quot;.\n\n    o   New help.request() function for compiling an e-mail to R-help\n        according to &quot;the rules&quot;. It is built on the new utility,\n        create.post() on which also bug.report() is based now; both\n        thanks to a contribution by Heather Turner.\n\n    o   help.search() now assumes that non-ASCII items are in latin1\n        if that makes sense (all known examples on CRAN are).\n\n    o   HoltWinters() and decompose() use a (statistically) more\n        efficient computation for seasonal fits (they used to waste\n        one period).\n\n    o   intToUtf8() and intToBits() now accept numeric vectors,\n        truncating them to integers.\n\n    o   is.unsorted() gains an argument 'strictly'.  It now works for\n        classed objects with a &gt;= or &gt; method (as incorrectly\n        documented earlier).\n\n    o   library() no longer warns about the masking objects that are\n        identical(.,.) to those they mask.\n\n    o   lockBinding(), unlockBinding(), lockEnvironment() and\n        makeActiveBinding() now all return invisibly (they always\n        return NULL).\n\n    o   mood.test() now behaves better in the presence of ties.\n\n    o   na.action() now works on fits of classes &quot;lm&quot;, &quot;glm&quot;, ....\n\n    o   optim(.., method=&quot;SANN&quot;, .., trace=TRUE) is now customizable via\n        the 'REPORT' control argument, thanks to code proposals by\n        Thomas Petzoldt.\n\n    o   The 'factory-fresh' defaults for options(&quot;device&quot;) have been\n        changed to refer to the devices as functions in the grDevices\n        namespace and not as names.  This makes it more likely that\n        the incorrect (since R 2.5.0) assumption in packages that\n        get(getOption(&quot;device&quot;))() will work will catch users of those\n        packages.\n\n    o   pch=16 now has no border (for consistency with 15, 17, 18) and\n        hence is now different from pch=19.\n\n    o   pdf() has new arguments 'useDingbats' (set this to FALSE for use\n        with broken viewers) and 'colormodel'.  It now only references\n        the ZapfDingbats font if it is used (for small opaque circles).\n\n        The default PDF version is now 1.4, since viewers that do not\n        accept that are now rare.\n\n        Different viewers were rendering consecutive text() calls on a\n        pdf() device in different ways where translucency was\n        involved.  The PDF generated has been changed to force each\n        call to be rendered separately (which is the way xpdf or\n        ghostscript was rendering, but Acrobat was forming a\n        transparency group), which is consistent with other graphics\n        devices supporting semi-transparency.\n\n    o   plot.dendrogram() has new arguments (xlim, ylim) which allows\n        zooming into a hiearchical clustering dendrogram.\n\n    o   plot.histogram() gains an 'ann' argument. (Wish from Ben Bolker.)\n\n    o   plot(&lt;lm_obj&gt;) now warns when it omits points with leverage one\n        from a plot.\n\n    o   Plotmath now recognizes 'aleph' and 'nabla' (the Adobe Symbol\n        'gradient' glyph) as symbol names.\n\n    o   polyroot() no longer has a maximum degree.\n\n    o   The alpha/alphamax argument of the 'nls' and 'mle' profile()\n        methods is used to compute confidence limits for univariate\n        t-statistics rather than a confidence region for all the\n        parameters (and not just those being profiled).\n\n    o   quantile.default() allows 'probs' to stray just beyond [0, 1],\n        to allow for computed values.\n\n    o   New functions rawConnection() and rawConnectionValue() allow\n        raw vectors to be treated as connections.\n\n    o   read.dcf() now consistently gives an error for malformed DCF.\n\n    o   read.fwf() no longer passes its default for 'as.is' to\n        read.table(): this allows the latter's default to be used.\n\n    o   readBin(), writeBin(), readChar() and writeChar() now open a\n        connection which was not already open in an appropriate binary\n        mode rather than the default mode.\n\n        readLines(), cat() and sink() now open a connection which was\n        not already open in an appropriate text mode rather than the\n        default mode.\n\n    o   readCitationFile() (and hence citation) now reads a package's\n        CITATION file in the package's declared encoding (if there is one).\n\n    o   The behaviour of readLines() for incomplete final lines on\n        binary-mode connections has been changed to be like blocking\n        rather than non-blocking text-mode connections.\n\n    o   A new reorder.character() method has been added.  This allows\n        use of 'reorder(x, ...)' as a shorthand for\n        'reorder(factor(x), ...)' when 'x' is a character vector.\n\n    o   round() now computes in long doubles where possible so the\n        results are more likely to be correct to representation error.\n\n    o   rug() now uses axis()'s new arguments from 2.7.2, hence no\n        longer draws an axis line.\n\n    o   save() (optionally, but by default) checks for the existence\n        of objects before opening the file/connections (wish of\n        PR#12543).\n\n    o   segments(), arrows() and rect() allow zero-length\n        coordinates.  (Wish of PR#11192)\n\n    o   set.seed(kind=NULL) now takes 'kind' from a saved seed if the\n        workspace has been restored or .Random.seed has been set in\n        some other way.  Previously it took the 'currently used' value,\n        which was &quot;default&quot; unless random numbers had been used in\n        the current session.  Similarly for the values reported by\n        RNGkind().  (Related to PR#12567.)\n\n        set.seed() gains a 'normal.kind' argument.\n\n    o   setEPS() and setPS() gain '...' to allow other arguments to be\n        passed to ps.options(), including overriding 'width' and 'height'.\n\n    o   setTimeLimit() function to set limits on the CPU\n        and/or elapsed time for each top-level computation, and\n        setSessionLimit() to set limits for the rest of the session.\n\n    o   splinefun() has a new method = &quot;monoH.FC&quot; for monotone Hermite\n        spline interpolation.\n\n    o   sprintf() optionally supports the %a/%A notation of C99 (if the\n        platform does, including under Windows).\n\n    o   str()'s default method gains a 'formatNum' function argument which\n        is used for formatting numeric vectors.  Note that this is very\n        slightly not backward compatible, and that its default may change\n        before release.\n\n    o   The summary() method for class &quot;ecdf&quot; now uses a print()\n        method rather than printing directly.\n\n    o   summary.manova() uses a stabler computation of the test\n        statistics, and gains a 'tol' argument to allow highly\n        correlated responses to be explored (with probable loss of\n        accuracy).  Similar changes have been made to anova.mlm() and\n        anova.mlmlist().\n\n    o   Sweave() now writes concordance information inside a\n        \\Sconcordance LaTeX macro, which allows it to be inserted into\n        PDF output.\n\n    o   system.time() now uses lazy evaluation rather than\n        eval/substitute, which results in more natural scoping. (PR#11169)\n\n    o   In table(), 'exclude=NULL' now does something also for factor\n        arguments. A new 'useNA' argument allows you to control\n        whether to add NA levels unconditionally or only when present\n        in data. A new convenience function addNA() gives similar\n        functionality by adding NA levels to individual factors.\n\n    o   unlink() tries the literal pattern if it does not match with\n        wildcards interpreted -- this helps with e.g. unlink(&quot;a[b&quot;)\n        which previously needed to be unlink(&quot;a\\\\[b&quot;).\n\n    o   update.packages() gains an argument 'oldPkgs', where\n        new.packages() and old.packages() get 'instPkgs'.  These allow to\n        consider only subsets of packages instead of all installed ones.\n\n    o   which(b) is somewhat faster now, notably for named vectors, thanks\n        to a suggestion by Henrik Bengtsson.\n\n    o   New generic function xtfrm() as an auxiliary helper for\n        sort(), order() and rank().  This should return a numeric\n        vector that sorts in the same way as its input.  The default\n        method supports any class with ==, &gt; and is.na() methods but\n        specific methods can be much faster.\n\n        As a side-effect, rank() will now work better on classed\n        objects, although possibly rather slowly.\n\n    o   X11() and capabilities(&quot;X11&quot;) now catch some X11 I/O errors that\n        previously terminated R.  These were rare and have only be\n        seen with a misconfigured X11 setup on some versions of X11.\n\n    o   The handling of nuls in character strings has been changed --\n        they are no longer allowed, and attempting to create such a\n        string now gives a truncation warning (unless\n        options(&quot;warnEscapes&quot;) is false).\n\n    o   The user environment and profile files can now be specified via\n        environment variables 'R_ENVIRON_USER' and 'R_PROFILE_USER',\n        respectively.\n\n    o   ?pkg::topic and ?pkg:::topic now find help on 'topic' from\n        package 'pkg' (and not help on :: or :::).\n\n    o   ??topic now does help.search(&quot;topic&quot;); variations such as\n        ??pkg::topic or field??topic are also supported.\n\n    o   There is support for using ICU (International Components for\n        Unicode) for collation, enabled by configure option --with-ICU\n        on a Unix-alike and by a setting in MkRules on Windows.\n        Function icuSetCollate() allows the collation rules (including\n        the locale) to be tuned.  [Experimental]\n\n    o   If S4 method dispatch is on and S4 objects are found as\n        attributes, show() rather than print() is used to print the\n        S4 attributes.\n\n    o   Starting package tcltk without access to Tk (e.g. no available\n        display) is now a warning rather than an error, as Tcl\n        will still be usable.  (On most platforms it was possible to\n        inhibit Tk by not having DISPLAY set, but not on Windows nor\n        Mac OS X builds with --with-aqua.)\n\n    o   Using $ on a non-subsettable object (such as a function) is\n        now an error (rather than returning NULL).\n\n    o   Hexadecimal numerical constants (such as 0xab.cdp+12) may now\n        contain a decimal point.\n\n    o   PCRE has been updated to version 7.8 (mainly bug fixes).\n\n    o   plot.ecdf() now defaults to pch=19 so as to better convey the\n        left-closed line segments.\n\nNEW FEATURES IN PACKAGE 'methods'\n\n    o   S3 classes that are registered by a call to setOldClass() now\n        have the S3 class as a special slot, and therefore so do\n        any S4 classes that contain them.  This mechanism is used to\n        support S4 classes that extend S3 classes, to the extent\n        possible.  See ?Classes, ?setOldClass, and ?S3Class.\n\n        The treatment of special pseudo-classes &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, and\n        &quot;ts&quot; as S4 classes has also been modified to be more\n        consistent and, within limitations imposed by special\n        treatment of these objects in the base code, to allow other\n        classes to contain them.  See class?ts.\n\n        A general feature added to implement &quot;ts&quot; and also\n        &quot;data.frame&quot; as S4 classes is that an S4 class definition can\n        be supplied to setOldClass() when the S3 class has known\n        attributes of known class.\n\n        setOldClass() now saves all the S3 inheritance, allowing the\n        calls to be built up in stages, rather than including all the\n        S3 classes in each call.  Also allows as(x,&quot;S3&quot;) to generate\n        valid S3 inheritance from the stored definition.  See ?S3.\n\n    o   S4 methods may now be defined corresponding to &quot;...&quot;, by\n        creating a generic function that has &quot;...&quot; as its signature.\n        A method will be selected and called if all the arguments\n        matching &quot;...&quot; are from this class or a subclass.  See ?dotsMethods.\n\n    o   New functions S3Part() and S3Class() provide access to the\n        corresponding S3 object and class for S4 classes that extend\n        either an S3 class or a basic R object type.\n\n    o   show(&lt;class definition&gt;) now also shows the class name.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   If sub-architectures are used, a copy of Rscript is installed\n        in ${R_HOME}/bin/exec${R_ARCH} (since that in ${R_HOME}/bin\n        and /usr/bin might be overwritten in a subsequent installation).\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION\n\n    o   LazyLoad: yes is now the default, so packages wanting to avoid\n        lazy loading must set 'LazyLoad: no' (or an equivalent value) in\n        the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL will now fail if it finds a non-executable\n        'configure' script in the package -- this usually indicates a\n        file system with insufficient permissions.  If a\n        non-executable 'cleanup' script is found and either\n        --clean or --preclean is used, a warning is given.\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   Use in packages of the graphics headers Rdevices.h and\n        Rgraphics.h is defunct: they are no longer installed.\n\n    o   options(&quot;par.ask.default&quot;) is defunct in favour of\n        &quot;device.ask.default&quot;.\n\n    o   The 'device-independent' family &quot;symbol&quot; is defunct: use\n        font=5 (base) or fontface=5 (grid) instead.\n\n    o   gammaCody() is defunct.\n\n    o   par(&quot;gamma&quot;) is defunct.\n\n    o   'methods' package functions getAccess(), getAllMethods(),\n        getClassName(), getClassPackage(), getExtends(),\n        getProperties(), getPrototype(), getSubclasses, getVirtual(),\n        mlistMetaName(), removeMethodsObject() and seemsS4Object() are\n        defunct.\n\n    o   Use of a non-integer .Random.seed is now an error.  (R itself\n        has never generated such values, but user code has, and\n        R &gt;= 2.6.0 has given a warning.)\n\n    o   methods::allGenerics() is deprecated.\n\n    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is now ignored, and\n        any use of the field will give a warning.\n\n    o   unserialize() no longer accepts character strings as input.\n\n    o   The C macro 'allocString' has been removed -- use 'mkChar' and\n        variants.\n\n    o   Use of allocVector(CHARSXP ...) is deprecated and gives a warning.\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o   The default for 'stylepath' in Sweave's (default) RweaveLatex\n        driver is now FALSE rather than TRUE if\n        SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT is unset : see ?RweaveLatex.\n        To support this, tools::texi2dvi adds the R 'texmf' directory\n        to the input search path.\n\n    o   R CMD Rd2dvi now previews PDF output (as was documented) if\n        R_PDFVIEWER is set (as it will normally be on a Unix-alike but\n        not on Windows, where the file association is used by default).\n\n    o   R CMD check checks for binary executable files (which should not\n        appear in a source package), using a suitable 'file' if\n        available, else by name.\n\n    o   R CMD check now also uses codetools' checks on the body of S4\n        methods.\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o   R_ReadConsole will now be called with a buffer size of 4096\n        bytes (rather than 1024): maintainers of alternative\n        front-ends should check that they do not have a smaller limit.\n\n    o   Graphics structure NewDevDesc has been renamed to DevDesc.\n        For now there is a compatibility define in GraphicsDevice.h,\n        but it will be removed in R 2.9.0.\n\n    o   PROTECT and UNPROTECT macros now work even with R_NO_REMAP.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   @ now gives an error (and not just a warning) if it is being\n        applied to a non-S4 object.\n\n    o   R CMD appends (not prepends) R's texmf path to TEXINPUTS.\n\n    o   Objects generated by new() from S4 classes should now all\n        satisfy isS4(object).  Previously, prototypes not of object\n        type S4 would not be S4 objects.  new() applied to basic,\n        non-S4 classes still will (and should) return non-S4 objects.\n\n    o   Functions writing to connections such as writeLines(),\n        writeBin(), writeChar(), save(), dput() and dump() now check\n        more carefully that the connections are opened for writing,\n        including connections that they open themselves.\n\n        Similarly functions which read such as readLines(), scan(),\n        dcf() and parse() check connections for being open for reading.\n\n    o   Equality comparison of factors with &lt;NA&gt; levels now works\n        correctly again.\n\n    o   Repainting of open X11 View() windows is now done whilst an\n        X11 dataentry window is in use.\n\n    o   Indexing of data frames with NA column names and a numeric or\n        logical column index works again even if columns with NA names\n        are selected.\n\n    o   on.exit() has been fixed to use lexical scope in determining\n        where to evaluate the exit action when the on.exit expression\n        appears in a function argument.\n\n    o   rank() now consistently returns a double result for\n        ties.method = &quot;average&quot; and an integer result otherwise.\n        Previously the storage mode depended on 'na.last' and if any\n        NAs were present.\n\n    o   The &quot;lm&quot; methods of add1(), and drop1() now also work on a model\n        fit with  na.action = na.exclude.\n\n    o   median(c(x = NA_real_)) no longer has spurious names().\n\n    o   isoreg(x, y) now returns the correct result also when x has ties,\n        in all cases.\n\n    o   What na.action() does is now correctly documented.\n\n    o   source() with echo=TRUE now behaves like ordinary automatic\n        printing, by using methods::show() for S4 objects.\n\n    o   Several bugs fixed in `?` with topics: it previously died trying\n        to construct some error messages; for S4 methods, class &quot;ANY&quot;\n        should be used for omitted arguments and default methods.\n\n    o   trace() should create missing traceable classes in the global\n        environment, not in baseenv() where other classes will not be\n        found.\n\n    o   Class inheritance using explicit coerce= methods via setIs()\n        failed  to coerce the argument in method dispatch.  With this\n        fixed, a mechanism was needed to prohibit such inheritance\n        when it would break the generic function (e.g.,\n        initialize). See ?setIs and ?setGeneric.\n\n    o   RSiteSearch() encodes its query (it seems this is occasionally\n        needed on some platforms, but encoding other fields is harmful).\n\n    o   'incomparables' in match() was looking up indices in the wrong\n        table.\n\n    o   write.dcf() did not escape &quot;.&quot; according to Debian policy\n        (PR#12816).\n\n    o   col2rgb() sometimes opened a graphics device unnecessarily, and\n        col2rgb(NA) did not return a transparent color, as documented.\n\n    o   pdf(family=&quot;Japan&quot;) [and other CIDfonts] no longer seg.faults\n        when writing &quot;western&quot; text strings.\n\n    o   as.list() applied to an environment now forces promises and\n        returns values.\n\n    o   Promises capturing calls to sys.parent() and friends did not\n        work properly when evaluated via method dispatch for internal\n        S3 generics.\n\n    o   The default pkgType option for non-CRAN builds of R on Mac OS X\n        is now correctly &quot;source&quot; as documented.\n\n    o   The default R_LIBS_USER path in AQUA builds now matches the\n        Mac-specifc path used by the Mac GUI: ~/Library/R/x.y/library\n\n    o   splinefun() with natural splines incorrectly evaluated derivatives\n        to the left of the first knot. (PR#13132, fix thanks to\n        Berwin Turlach)\n\n    o   anova(glm(..., y=FALSE)) now works.  (PR#13098)\n\n    o   cut.Date(x, &quot;weeks&quot;) could fail if x has only one unique value\n        which fell on a week boundary.

Similarly for paste(), elements of the\n\tresult are in UTF-8 when any input to that element is declared\n\tas UTF-8.\n\n    o\taxis() has new arguments 'col.ticks' and 'lwd.ticks' to allow\n\tthe colour and line width of ticks to be set separately from\n\tthat of the line (e.g. to set one or the other to transparent\n\tor zero width).\n\n    o\tlegend() has a new argument 'box.col' to set the colour of the\n\tenclosing box.\n\n    o\tlegend() gains a 'xpd' argument to make it easier to place a\n\tlegend in the margins or outer margins.\n\n    o\tstripchart() now passes '...' to title() (as well as to\n\tplot.default() and axis()). (Wish of PR#12202)\n\n    o\thelp.search() has new argument 'searchEngine' to go\n\tdirectly to the search form: this is needed by users of\n\tFirefox 3 to workaround a bug in interpreting the search\n\tresults pages.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tPlotmath computed the glyph metrics for the wrong character (and\n\tperhaps for a non-existent one) if this was a single-byte\n\tcharacter with the top bit set.  An example was\tsymbol(&quot;\\300&quot;).\n\n    o\tsink() and cat() could divert output to a non-writable connection.\n\n    o\tphyper(x, 0,0,0) no longer hangs for huge x and gives 1 for x &gt;= 0.\n\t(PR#11813)\n\n    o\tplnorm(x, ..., log.p=TRUE) is now correct for x &lt;= 0. (PR#11867)\n\n    o\t&lt;data.frame&gt;[, ch] gives an error (again!) when ch is a string not\n\texactly matching the column names, thanks to an oral bug report by\n\tMatthew Dowle.\n\n    o\tdata.frame(x=1:2, y=3:4, row.names=c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;NA&quot;))[c(2,NA),] has\n\tcorrect row names c(&quot;NA,&quot;NA.1&quot;) again.\n\n    o\tThe GUI data editor for dataframes did not handle escape\n\tcharacters in entries properly. (PR#11897)\n\n    o\tPCRE has been updated to 7.7 (bugfix release).\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() wrongly warned about invalid code_files names\n\twhen these were not in the current directory.\n\n    o\tshapiro.test(c(0,0,1)) now has P value &gt;= 0 (instead of barely\n\tnegative).\n\n    o\tassign() now warns if given a character vector of length &gt; 1,\n\trather than silently taking the first element.\n\n    o\trcond(&lt;exactly singular matrix&gt;) now gives 0 instead of an error.\n\n    o\tThere was a memory leak in C function ucstoutf8 used by some\n\tgraphics devices.\n\n    o\tPlots of profile.mle() objects (package 'stats4') were\n\tmisbehaving when the 'which' argument had been used in their\n\tcalculation.\n\n    o\tdnbinom(x, size, mu=*, ..) is now more accurate for very large\n\t'size'.  The same applies to pnbinom() and rnbinom().\n\n    o\taxis() was ignoring par() mgp[3] if mgp was set in-line.\n\n    o\tClosing an X11 View() or dataentry window via its frame's\n\tclose control now works better on some window managers.\n\n    o\tCalling lapply() was not handling method dispatch correctly for\n\tis.numeric(), is.matrix(), is.array(), log() and the Math2\n\tgroup.  This affected data.matrix() which incorrectly regarded\n\t&quot;Date&quot; and &quot;POSIXct&quot; objects as numeric, and has been adjusted\n\tto do so as exceptions.\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() was not looking for non-function objects in\n    \tits 'environment' argument.\n\n    o\tnls() was only finding its 'weights' argument in the case when\n    \tall the variables in the formula were of the same length and\n    \thence that model.frame() could be used.\n\n\tIt was silently ignoring 'subset' and 'na.action' except in\n\tthat case.  Now they are ignored only if 'data' is a list and\n\tvariables taken from 'data' are not all of the same length,\n\tin which case a warning is given.\n\n    o\tThe 'mle' confint() method now takes 'level' into account when\n\tsetting 'alpha' for the profile.\n\n    o\twithin() was not handling correctly expressions that produced\n\tNULL columns.  (PR#11131)\n\n    o\tdev.print() and dev.copy2{eps,pdf}() now ensure that the current\n\tdevice is restored as the active device even if an error\n\toccurs. (PR#9801)\n\n    o\tas.Date() could fail to convert character strings representing\n\tdays on which midnight did not exist in the current timezone\n\t(as happened in parts of Africa on 1960-01-01).\n\n    o\tThe automatic placement of legend() with 'title' and a\n\treversed 'x' axis was incorrect. (PR#12019)\n\n    o\tThe use of multiple packages in 'LinkingTo' works again, and\n    \tnow works when the dependent packages are in the library to be\n    \tinstalled to (but not in the library path seen by R --vanilla).\n\n    o\tbxp() (and hence boxplot) now respects in-line graphical\n\tparameters 'xaxp'/'yaxp' as appropriate.  (PR#11463)\n\n    o\tbarplot(log = &quot;y&quot;) failed if there were NAs in the 'height'\n\targument.  (PR#11585)\n\n    o\tpbeta() is more accurate in some cases with extreme values of\n\t'ncp'.  (PR#11277).\n\n    o\tedit.data.frame() no longer fails if called on a 0-column\n\tdata frame and no column is created.\n\n    o\tpchisq(x, df=0) was always one even for x &lt; 0; similarly for\n\tpgamma(x, alpha=0).\n\n    o\tadd1() and drop1() now return a P-value of NaN in cases with\n\tdf=0 for test=&quot;Chisq&quot; (they gave NaN until pchisq was altered\n\tin R 2.6.2).\n\n    o\tThe default methods of drop1() and add1() now re-evaluate in the\n\tobject's formula environment, rather than simply in the parent\n\t(informal bug report by Werner Stahel).\n\n    o\tThe undocumented limit of 8191 bytes on comments (from # to\n\tthe end of the line) in R code has been removed.\n\n    o\tqgamma() warns if used with shape &lt; 1e-10, when it may be\n \tunreliable.  (PR#12324)\n\n    o\tInstalling a source package was not using the package's declared\n\tencoding (if any) as a default encoding for the help.search()\n\tdatabase in Meta/hsearch.rds.  This could cause packages with\n\ta default encoding to have some of their entries rejected by\n\thelp.search() in a multi-byte locale (such as a UTF-8 locale).\n\n    o\tduplicated() and unique() now handle 'incomparables' better,\n    \tand avoid occasional segfaults (PR#12551).\n\n    o\tdata.frame(row.names=NULL) once again behaves differently from\n\tthe default (as documented).\n\n    o\tplot(isoreg(x,y)) now plots the points correctly, also when 'x'\n\tis not sorted.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

Similarly, '.' is now always non-numeric.\n\n    o   CITATION files are now read in Latin-1: quite a few were\n        failing if used in a multibyte locale such as UTF-8.\n\n    o   The DESCRIPTION file of a package can specify an 'OS_type' field\n        as either 'unix' or 'windows' to confine installation to that\n        OS type.\n\n    o   HoltWinters() now uses optimize() rather than optim for\n        one-parameter problems which should be more reliable (PR#11469).\n\n    o   axis() now respects the setting of par(&quot;xpd&quot;) when clipping.\n\n    o   The 'factor' method of format() now preserves names, dims and\n        dimnames in the same way as for character and numeric inputs.\n        (PR#11512)\n\n    o   read.DIF(*, transpose=TRUE) now allows to correctly read DIF files\n        produced by some versions of Excel.\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   The use of unserialize() on character strings is deprecated:\n        that was a format used in R &lt; 2.4.0.\n\n    o   The use of embedded nuls in character strings is deprecated:\n        They will no longer be allowed in R 2.8.0.\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o   R CMD check checks for possible check directories in the\n        sources -- in mid-2008 there were about 20 examples on CRAN.\n\n    o   R CMD build tries harder to clean up the inst/doc directory\n        from the remnants of earlier builds.\n\n        It also removes any directories with extension .Rcheck, and\n        files .DS_Store and ._* (created by tar on Mac OS X under some\n        circumstances: it now sets environment variables to ask for\n        such files not to be created by that tar.)\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Encoding&lt;- on NA_character_ converted it to &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o   Adobe Symbol was missing from the encodings in\n        tools::charset_to_Unicode.\n\n    o   diag(matrix(x, 0, 0)) now returns a 0-length vector of the\n        correct mode, instead of always numeric.\n\n    o   The parser sometimes accepted invalid quoted strings in a UTF-8\n        locale.\n\n    o   plot.default(x, y) now dispatches to Axis() methods whether\n        y is NULL or not.\n\n    o   On Mac OS X, the Cocoa Quartz window could close without warning\n        under certain circumstances (specific autorelease pool flush).\n\n    o   Plotting symbols with separate border and fill colours (e.g.,\n        plot(pch = 21)) now works with transparent 'col', but opaque\n        or semi-transparent 'bg'.  Previously, if 'col' was\n        transparent then 'bg' was ignored and nothing was drawn.\n\n    o   file.path() did not work correctly in 2.7.0 if the components\n        had different encodings.\n\n    o   merge() failed if there were no common columns and one of the\n        inputs had zero rows.\n\n    o   expand.grid() failed if an input had length 0.\n\n    o   match() does again truncate strings at embedded nuls (as newly\n        documented in 2.7.0).\n\n    o   Because of a typo, 'pointsize' in png(type=&quot;cairo&quot;) (and jpeg,\n        bmp, tiff) devices was being interpreted in pixels not bigpoints.\n\n    o   is() was wrong for some S3 class objects with class of length\n        greater than one.\n\n    o   undoc() / codoc() were not checking all S4 methods in some cases.\n\n    o   Use of textConnection(NULL, mode=&quot;w&quot;) could segfault.\n\n    o   Use of strwidth/height(units=&quot;user&quot;) (the default) is again an\n        error before a user coordinate system has been set on the\n        device, rather than giving nonsensical values (the effect of\n        r31367).\n\n    o   Rare string width calculations in package grid were not\n        interpreting the string encoding correctly.\n\n    o   hasMethods(f, env) {without specified 'package'} now works better.\n\n    o   A missing PROTECT could cause segfaults on string\n        comparisons.  (PR#11421)\n\n    o   str(structure(1, classID = &quot;Pooh&quot;)) now works fine.\n\n    o   A missing PROTECT could cause segfaults in if() if coercion of\n        the condition was required or a warning was to be given.\n\n    o   plot(&lt;table&gt;) now uses a sensible default main title.\n\n    o   validObject() called with complete=TRUE did not use inherited\n        validity methods for slot classes.\n\n    o   Several bugs fixed in as(): the initial method lookup was not\n        using the table with inherited methods (so inheritance had to\n        be recomputed each time); coerce() should not be called\n        directly--it can insert invalid inherited methods; the\n        constructed as() methods were not retaining the function's\n        environment.\n\n    o   influence.measures(&lt;glm-object&gt;) now computes the same\n        Cook's distance approximations as cooks.distance().\n\n    o   plot(&lt;glm&gt;, which=5) uses more correct Cook's distance contours;\n        (fix to fix to PR#9316).\n\n    o   pdf() and postscript() were not working correctly in 2.7.0 with\n        UTF-8 encoded data in a non-UTF-8 MBCS (e.g. EUC-JP on Unix,\n        CJK locales on Windows).\n\n    o   conformMethod(), called by setMethod(), now checks better about\n        argument names in wrong order.  Whereas it only warns currently,\n        it is planned to become an error in the future.\n\n    o   The predict() method for prcomp() had an incorrect check for\n        the number of columns of 'newdata' if the columns were not named.\n\n    o   The axis() function now distinguishes between setting &quot;at&quot; to\n        NULL or a zero-length vector, treating the latter as a request\n        for no ticks.  This corrects the handling of the &quot;x&quot; parameter\n        to rug().\n\n    o   glob2rx(&quot;*[*&quot;) now produces a correct regular expression.\n\n    o   The canvas is no longer painted on copy or save in Cocoa Quartz.\n\n    o   identify() in Quartz can now be terminated by either using popup\n        menu equivalent (Ctrl-click or second mouse button) or by pressing\n        the &lt;Esc&gt; key. The latter was documented but did not work.\n\n    o   tools:::.check_package_depends() {called from 'R CMD check'} now\n        also works correctly when directory-name != package-name.\n\n    o   Source references were sometimes off by a line.\n\n    o   The quartz() parameter 'antialias' is no longer ignored.\n\n    o   The Quartz device is now trying hard to remove anti-aliasing\n        effects for rasterized backends in plots that use adjacent,\n        borderless rectangles such as image().\n\n    o   The srcfilecopy() function now adds a timestamp to the object it\n        creates.\n\n    o   parse() would lose a token when run on stdin().\n\n    o   socketConnection() was using internally the class &quot;socket&quot;\n        and not &quot;sockconn&quot;, which caused a conflict with make.socket().\n        (PR#11515)\n\n    o   Quartz is now trying harder to find the proper font for a given\n        family which resolves font issues on Mac OS X 10.4. Full font\n        names and PostScript names can be used interchangeably. (Note,\n        however that italic/oblique font faces of Helvetica are not\n        included in the Mac OS X 10.4 system).\n\n    o   qf() no longer gives NaN when one of df1 and df2 is large and\n        the other is infinite (including if both are infinite); it is more\n        accurate e.g. for qf(1e-18, 2,4).\n\n    o   qbeta(-1e10, 50, 40, log.p=TRUE) no longer hangs.\n\n    o   Cocoa Quartz backend autodetection of display DPI was not\n        correct for screens rotated by 90 or 270 degrees.\n\n    o   selectMethod(&quot;coerce&quot;, .) now uses a correct default for\n        'useInherited', and hence no longer may mess up the method cache.\n\n    o   show() now also works on &quot;unregistered&quot; S3 class objects.\n\n    o   formatC(*, format=&quot;fg&quot;, flag=&quot;#&quot;) is no longer dropping trailing\n        zeros.\n\n    o   read.table(file = stdin()) with invalid input could leave the\n        connection in an invalid state and hence cause a later\n        segfault.  (PR#11627)\n\n    o   read.DIF() did not obey the default 'stringsAsFactors = TRUE'.\n\n    o   The 'noquote' method for c() now works correctly with three or\n        more arguments.\n\n    o   symbol() in plotmath expressions works again with non-ASCII\n        input on devices that use UTF-8 for the symbol font.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

[PDF viewers are now\n        more widely available than PostScript viewers.]\n\n        The default width and height for pdf() and bitmap() have been\n        changed to 7 (inches) to match the screen devices.\n\n    o   Most users of the X11() device will see a new device that has\n        different fonts, anti-aliasing of lines and fonts and\n        supports semi-transparent colours.\n\n    o   Considerable efforts have been made to make the default output\n        from graphics devices as similar as possible (and in\n        particular close to that from postscript/pdf).  Many devices\n        were misinterpreting 'pointsize' in some way, for example as\n        being in device units (pixels) rather than in points.\n\n    o   Packages which include graphics devices need to be re-installed\n        for this version of R, with recently updated versions.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   The apse code used by agrep() has been updated to version\n        0.16, with various bug fixes.\n\n        agrep() now supports multibyte character sets.\n\n    o   any() and all() avoid coercing zero-length arguments (which\n        used a surprising amount of memory) since they cannot affect\n        the answer.\n\n        Coercion of other than integer arguments now gives a warning\n        as this is often a mistake (e.g. writing all(pr) &gt; 0 instead\n        of all(pr &gt; 0) ).\n\n    o   as.Date(), as.POSIXct() and as.POSIXlt() now convert numeric\n        arguments (days or seconds since some epoch) provided the\n        'origin' argument is specified.\n\n    o   New function as.octmode() to create objects such as file\n        permissions.\n\n    o   as.POSIXlt() is now generic, and it and as.POSIXct() gain a\n        '...' argument.  The character/factor methods now accept a\n        'format' argument (analogous to that for as.Date).\n\n    o   New function browseVignettes() lists available vignettes in an\n        HTML browser with links to PDF, Rnw, and R files.\n\n    o   There are new capabilities &quot;aqua&quot; (for the AQUA GUI and quartz()\n        device on Mac OS X) and &quot;cairo&quot; (for cairo-based graphics\n        devices).\n\n    o   New function checkNEWS() in package 'tools' that detects common\n        errors in NEWS file formatting.\n\n    o   deparse() gains a new argument 'nlines' to limit the number of\n        lines of output, and this is used internally to make several\n        functions more efficient.\n\n    o   deriv() now knows the derivatives of digamma(x), trigamma(x)\n        and psigamma(x, deriv) (wrt to x).\n\n    o   dir.create() has a new argument 'mode', used on Unix-alikes\n        (only) to set the permissions on the created directory.\n\n    o   Where an array is dropped to a length-one vector by drop() or\n        [, drop = TRUE], the result now has names if exactly one of\n        the dimensions was named.  (This is compatible with S.)\n        Previously there were no names.\n\n    o   The 'incomparables' argument to duplicated(), unique() and\n        match() is now implemented, and passed to match() from merge().\n\n    o   dyn.load() gains a 'DLLpath' argument to specify the path for\n        dependent DLLs: currently only used on Windows.\n\n    o   The spreadsheet edit() methods (and used by fix()) for data\n        frames and matrices now warn when classes are discarded.\n\n        When editing a data frame, columns of unknown type (that is\n        not numeric, logical, character or factor) are now converted\n        to character (instead of numeric).\n\n    o   file.create() has a new argument 'showWarnings' (default TRUE)\n        to show an informative warning when creation fails, and\n        dir.create() warns under more error conditions.\n\n    o   New higher-order functions Find(), Negate() and Position().\n\n    o   [dpqr]gamma(*, shape = 0) now work as limits of 'shape -&gt; 0',\n        corresponding to the point distribution with all mass at 0.\n\n    o   An informative warning (in addition to the error message) will\n        be given when the basic, extended or perl mode of grep(),\n        strsplit() and friends fails to compile the pattern.\n\n    o   More study is done of perl=TRUE patterns in grep() and friends\n        when length(x) &gt; 10: this should improve performance on long\n        vectors.\n\n    o   grep(), strsplit() and friends with fixed=TRUE or perl=TRUE\n        work in UTF-8 and preserve the UTF-8 encoding for UTF-8 inputs\n        where supported.\n\n    o   help.search() now builds the database about 3x times faster.\n\n    o   iconv() now accepts &quot;UTF8&quot; on all platforms (many did, but not\n        e.g. libiconv as used on Windows).\n\n    o   identity() convenience function to be used for programming.\n\n    o   In addition to warning when 'pkgs' is not found,\n        install.packages() now reports if it finds a valid package\n        with only a case mismatch in the name.\n\n    o   intToUtf8() now marks the Encoding of its output.\n\n    o   The function is() now works with S3 inheritance; that is, with\n        objects having multiple strings in the class attribute.\n\n    o   Extensions to condition number computation for matrices, notably\n        complex ones are provided, both in kappa() and the new rcond().\n\n    o   list.file() gains a 'ignore.case' argument, to allow\n        case-insensitive matching on some Windows/MacOS file systems.\n\n    o   ls.str() and lsf.str() have slightly changed arguments and\n        defaults such that ls.str() {no arguments} works when debugging.\n\n    o   Under Unix, utils::make.packages.html() can now be used directly\n        to set up linked HTML help pages, optionally without creating\n        the package listing and search database (which can be much\n        faster).\n\n    o   new.packages() now knows about the front-end package gnomeGUI\n        (which does not install into a library).\n\n    o   optim(*, control = list(...)) now warns when '...' contains\n        unexpected names, instead of silently ignoring them.\n\n    o   The options &quot;browser&quot; and &quot;editor&quot; may now be set to functions,\n        just as &quot;pager&quot; already could.\n\n    o   packageDescription() makes use of installed metadata where\n        available (for speed, e.g. in make.packages.html()).\n\n    o   pairwise.t.test() and pairwise.wilcox.test() now more explicitly\n        allow paired tests. In the former case it is now flagged as an\n        error if both 'paired' and 'pool.SD' are set TRUE (formerly,\n        'paired' was silently ignored), and one-sided tests are generated\n        according to 'alternative' also if 'pool.SD' is TRUE.\n\n    o   paste() and file.path() are now completely internal, for speed.\n        (This speeds up make.packages.html(packages=FALSE)\n        severalfold, for example.)\n\n    o   paste() now sets the encoding on the result under some\n        circumstances (see ?paste).\n\n    o   predict.loess() now works when loess() was fitted with\n        transformed explanatory variables, e.g, loess(y ~ log(x) + log(z)).\n\n    o   print(&lt;data.frame&gt;)'s new argument 'row.names' allows to suppress\n        printing rownames.\n\n    o   print() and str() now also &quot;work&quot; for 'logLik' vectors longer than\n        one.\n\n    o   Progress-bar functions txtProgressBar(), tkProgressBar() in\n        package tcltk and winProgressBar() (Windows only).\n\n    o   readChar() gains an argument 'useBytes' to allow it to read a\n        fixed number of bytes in an MBCS locale.\n\n    o   readNEWS() has been moved to the tools package.\n\n    o   round() and signif() now do internal argument matching if\n        supplied with two arguments and at least one is named.\n\n    o   New function showNonASCII() in package tools to aid detection\n        of non-ASCII characters in .R and .Rd files.\n\n    o   The [dpq]signrank() functions now typically use considerably\n        less memory than previously, thanks to a patch from Ivo\n        Ugrina.\n\n    o   spec.ar() now uses frequency(x) when calculating the\n        frequencies of the estimated spectrum, so that for monthly\n        series the frequencies are now per year (as for spec.pgram)\n        rather than per month as before.\n\n    o   spline() gets an 'xout' argument, analogously to approx().\n\n    o   sprintf() now does all the conversions needed in a first pass if\n        length(fmt) == 1, and so can be many times faster if called\n        with long vector arguments.\n\n    o   [g]sub(useBytes = FALSE) now sets the encoding on changed\n        elements of the result when working on an element of known\n        encoding.  (This was previously done only for perl = TRUE.)\n\n    o   New function Sys.chmod(), a wrapper for 'chmod' on platforms\n        which support it.  (On Windows it handles only the read-only\n        bit.)\n\n    o   New function Sys.umask(), a wrapper for 'umask' on platforms\n        which support it.\n\n    o   New bindings ttk*() in package tcltk for the 'themed widgets'\n        of Tk 8.5.  The tcltk demos make use of these widgets where\n        available.\n\n    o   write.table(d, row.names=FALSE) is faster when 'd' has millions of\n        rows; in particular for a data frame with automatic row names.\n        (Suggestion from Martin Morgan.)\n\n\n    o   The parser limit on string size has been removed.\n\n    o   If a NEWS file is present in the root of a source package, it\n        is installed (analogously to LICENSE, LICENCE and COPYING).\n\n    o   Rd conversion to 'example' now quotes aliases which contain\n        spaces.\n\n    o   The handling of DST on dates outside the range 1902-2037 has\n        been improved.  Dates after 2037 are assumed to have the same\n        DST rules as currently predicted for the 2030's (rather than\n        the 1970s), and dates prior to 1902 are assumed to have no DST\n        and the same offset as in 1902 (if known, otherwise as in the\n        1970s).\n\n    o   On platforms where we can detect that mktime sets errno\n        (e.g. Solaris and the code used on Windows but not Linux nor\n        Mac OS X), 1969-12-31 23:59:59 GMT is converted from POSIXlt\n        to POSIXct as -1 and not NA.\n\n    o   The definition of 'whitespace' used by the parser is slightly\n        wider: it includes Unicode space characters on Windows and in\n        UTF-8 locales on machines which use Unicode wide characters.\n\n    o   The src/extra/intl sources have been updated to those from\n        gettext 0.17.\n\n    o   New flag --interactive on Unix-alikes forces the session to be\n        interactive (as --ess does on Windows).\n\n    o   x[&lt;zero-length&gt;] &lt;- NULL is always a no-op: previously\n        type-checking was done on the replacement value and so this\n        failed, whereas we now assume NULL can be promoted to any\n        zero-length vector-like object.\n\n        Other cases of a zero-length index are done more efficiently.\n\n    o   There is a new option in Rd markup of \\donttest{} to mark\n        example code that should be run by example() but not tested\n        (e.g. because it might fail in some locales).\n\n    o   The error handler in the parser now reports line numbers for\n        more syntax errors (MBCS and Unicode encoding errors, line\n        length and context stack overflows, and mis-specified argument\n        lists to functions).\n\n    o   The &quot;MethodsList&quot; objects originally used for method selection\n        are being phased out.  New utilities provide simpler\n        alternatives (see ?findMethods), and direct use of the mangled\n        names for the objects is now deprecated.\n\n    o   Creating new S4 class and method definitions in an environment\n        that could not be identified (as package, namespace or global)\n        previously generated an error.  It now results in creating and\n        using an artificial package name from the current date/time,\n        with a warning.  See ?getPackageName.\n\n    o   Unix-alikes now give a warning on startup if locale settings\n        fail.  (The Windows port has long done so.)\n\n    o   Parsing and scanning of numerical constants is now done by R's\n        own C code.  This ensures cross-platform consistency, and\n        mitigates the effects of setting LC_NUMERIC (within base R it\n        only applies to output -- packages may differ).\n\n        The format accepted is more general than before and includes\n        binary exponents in hexadecimal constants: see\n        ?NumericConstants for details.\n\n    o   Dependence specifications for R or packages in the Depends\n        field in a DESCRIPTION file can now make use of operators\n        &lt; &gt; == and != (in addition to &lt;= and &gt;=): such packages will\n        not be installable nor loadable in R &lt; 2.7.0.\n\n        There can be multiple mentions of R or a package in the Depends\n        field in a DESCRIPTION file: only the first mention will be\n        used in R &lt; 2.7.0.\n\n\nGRAPHICS CHANGES\n\n    o   The default graphics devices in interactive and\n        non-interactive sessions are now configurable via environment\n        variables R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE and R_DEFAULT_DEVICE\n        respectively.\n\n    o   New function dev.new() to launch a new copy of the default\n        graphics device (and taking care if it is &quot;pdf&quot; or\n        &quot;postscript&quot; not to trample on the file of an already running\n        copy).\n\n    o   dev.copy2eps() uses dev.displaylist() to detect screen\n        devices, rather than list them in the function.\n\n    o   New function dev.copy2pdf(), the analogue of dev.copy2eps().\n\n    o   dev.interactive() no longer treats a graphics device as\n        interactive if it has a display list (but devices can still\n        register themselves on the list of interactive devices).\n\n    o   The X11() and windows() graphics devices have a new argument\n        'title' to set the window title.\n\n    o   X11() now has the defaults for all of its arguments set by the\n        new function X11.options(), inter alia replacing options\n        &quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;colortype&quot; and &quot;X11fonts&quot;.\n\n    o   ps.options() now warns on unused option 'append'.\n\n        xfig() no longer takes default arguments from ps.options().\n        (This was not documented prior to 2.6.1 patched.)\n\n        pdf() now takes defaults from the new function pdf.options()\n        rather that from ps.options() (and the latter was not\n        documented prior to 2.6.1 patched).\n\n        The defaults for all arguments other than 'file' in\n        postscript() and pdf() can now be set by ps.options() or\n        pdf.options()\n\n    o   New functions setEPS() and setPS() as wrappers to ps.options()\n        to set appropriate defaults for figures for inclusion in other\n        documents and for spooling to a printer respectively.\n\n    o   The meaning of numeric 'pch' has been extended where MBCSes are\n        supported.  Now negative integer values indicate Unicode\n        points, integer values in 32-127 represent ASCII characters,\n        and 128-255 are valid only in single-byte locales.\n        (Previously what happened with negative pch values was\n        undocumented: they were replaced by the current setting of\n        par(&quot;pch&quot;).)\n\n    o   Graphics devices can say if they can rotate text well\n        (e.g. postscript() and pdf() can) and if so the device's\n        native text becomes the default for contour labels rather than\n        using Hershey fonts.\n\n    o   The setting of the line spacing (par(&quot;cra&quot;)[2]) on the X11() and\n        windows() devices is now comparable with postscript() etc, and\n        roughly 20% smaller than before (it used to depend on the\n        locale for X11).  (So is the pictex() device, now 20% larger.)\n        This affects the margin size in plots, and should result in\n        better-looking plots.\n\n    o   There is a per-device setting for whether new frames need\n        confirmation.  This is controlled by either par(&quot;ask&quot;) or\n        grid.prompt() and affects all subsequent plots on the device\n        using base or grid graphics.\n\n    o   There is a new version of the X11() device based on cairo\n        graphics which is selected by type &quot;cairo&quot; or &quot;nbcairo&quot;, and\n        is available on machines with cairo installed and preferably\n        pango (which most machines with gtk+ &gt;= 2.8 will have).  This\n        version supports translucent colours and normally does a\n        better job of font selection so it has been possible to\n        display (e.g.)  English, Polish, Russian and Japanese text on\n        a single X11() window.  It is the default where available.\n\n        There is a companion function, savePlot(), to save the current\n        plot to a PNG file.\n\n        On Unix-alikes, devices jpeg() and png() also accept\n        type = &quot;cairo&quot;, and with that option do not need a running\n        X server.  The meaning of capabilities(&quot;jpeg&quot;) and\n        capabilities(&quot;png&quot;) has changed to reflect this.  On MacOS X,\n        there is a further type = &quot;quartz&quot;.  The default type is\n        selected by the new option &quot;bitmapType&quot;, and is &quot;quartz&quot; or\n        &quot;cairo&quot; where available.\n\n        Where cairo 1.2 or later is supported, there is a svg() device\n        to write SVG files, and cairo_pdf() and cairo_ps() devices to\n        write (possibly bitmap) PDF and postscript files via cairo.\n\n        Some features require cairo &gt;= 1.2, and some which are\n        nominally supported under 1.2 seem to need 1.4 to work well.\n\n    o   There are new bmp() and tiff() devices.\n\n    o   New function devSize() to report the size of the current\n        graphics device surface (in inches or device units).  This\n        gives the same information as par(&quot;din&quot;), but independent of\n        the graphics subsystem.\n\n    o   New base graphics function clip() to set the clipping region (in\n        user coordinates).\n\n    o   New functions grconvertX() and grconvertY() to convert between\n        coordinate systems in base graphics.\n\n    o   identify() recycles its 'labels' argument if necessary.\n\n    o   stripchart() is now a generic function, with default and\n        formula methods defined.  Additional graphics parameters may\n        be included in the call.  Formula handling is now\n        similar to boxplot().\n\n    o   strwidth() and strheight() gain 'font' and 'vfont' arguments and\n        accept in-line pars such as 'family' in the same way as text()\n        does.  (Longstanding wish of PR#776)\n\n    o   example(ask=TRUE) now applies to grid graphics (e.g. from\n        lattice) as well as to base graphics.\n\n    o   Option &quot;device.ask.default&quot; replaces &quot;par.ask.default&quot; now it\n        applies also to grid.prompt().\n\n    o   plot.formula() only prompts between plots for interactive\n        devices (it used to prompt for all devices).\n\n    o   When plot.default() is called with y=NULL it now calls Axis()\n        with the 'y' it constructs rather than use the default axis.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is defunct and\n        lazyloading is attempted instead.\n\n    o   $ on an atomic vector or S4 object is now defunct.\n\n    o   Partial matching in [[ is now only performed if explicitly\n        requested (by exact=FALSE or exact=NA).\n\n    o   Command-line completion has been moved from package 'rcompgen'\n        to package 'utils': the former no longer exists as a separate\n        package in the R distribution.\n\n    o   The S4 pseudo-classes &quot;single&quot; and double have been removed.\n        (The S4 class for a REALSXP is &quot;numeric&quot;: for back-compatibility\n        as(x, &quot;double&quot;) coerces to &quot;numeric&quot;.)\n\n    o   gpar(gamma=) in the grid package is now defunct.\n\n    o   Several S4 class definition utilities, get*(), have been said\n        to be deprecated since R 1.8.0; these are now formally deprecated.\n        Ditto for removeMethodsObject().\n\n    o   Use of the graphics headers Rgraphics.h and Rdevices.h is\n        deprecated, and these will be unavailable in R 2.8.0.\n        (They are hardly used except in graphics devices, for which\n        there is an updated API in this version of R.)\n\n    o   options(&quot;par.ask.default&quot;) is deprecated in favour of\n        &quot;device.ask.default&quot;.\n\n    o   The 'device-independent' family &quot;symbol&quot; is deprecated as it was\n        highly locale- and device-dependent (it only did something\n        useful in single-byte locales on most devices) and font=5\n        (base) or fontface=5 (grid) did the job it was intended to do\n        more reliably.\n\n    o   gammaCody() is now formally deprecated.\n\n    o   Two low-level functions using MethodsList metadata objects\n        (mlistMetaName() and getAllMethods()) are deprecated.\n\n    o   Setting par(gamma=) is now deprecated, and the windows()\n        device (the only known example) no longer allows it.\n\n    o   The C macro 'allocString' will be removed in 2.8.0 -- use\n        'mkChar', or 'allocVector' directly if really necessary.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   Tcl/Tk &gt;= 8.3 (released in 2000) is now required to build\n        package tcltk.\n\n    o   configure first tries TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC and TK_INCLUDE_SPEC\n        when looking for Tcl/Tk headers.  (The existing scheme did\n        not work for the ActiveTcl package on Mac OS X.)\n\n    o   The Windows build only supports Windows 2000 or later (XP,\n        Vista, Server 2003 and Server 2008).\n\n    o   New option --enable-R-static-lib installs libR.a which can\n        be linked to a front-end via 'R CMD config --ldflags'.\n        The tests/Embedding examples now work with a static R\n        library.\n\n    o   Netscape (which was discontinued in Feb 2008) is no longer\n        considered when selecting a browser.\n\n    o   xdg-open (the freedesktop.org interface to\n        kfmclient/gnome-open/...) is considered as a possible browser,\n        after real browsers such as firefox, mozilla and opera.\n\n    o   The search for tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh now only looks in\n        directories with names containing $(LIBnn) in the hope of\n        finding the version for the appropriate architecture\n        (e.g. x86_64 or i386).\n\n    o   libtool has been updated to version 2.2.\n\n    o   Use of --with-system-zlib, --with-system-bzlib or\n        --with-system-pcre now requires version &gt;= 1.2.3, 1.0.5, 7.6\n        respectively, for security.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o   Rdconv now removes empty sections including alias and keyword\n        entries, with a note.\n\n    o   Keyword entries are no longer mandatory in Rd files.\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL now also installs tangled versions of all vignettes.\n\n    o   R CMD check now warns if spaces or non-ASCII characters are\n        used in file paths, since these are not in general portable.\n\n    o   R CMD check (via massage-examples.pl) now checks all examples\n        with a 7 inch square device region on A4 paper, for\n        locale-independence and to be similar to viewing examples on\n        an on-screen device.\n\n        If a package declares an encoding in the DESCRIPTION file,\n        the examples are assumed to be in that encoding when running\n        the tests. (This avoids errors in running latin1 examples in a\n        UTF-8 locale.)\n\n    o   R CMD check uses pdflatex (if available) to check the typeset\n        version of the manual, producing PDF rather than DVI.  (This\n        is a better check since the package reference manuals on CRAN\n        are in PDF.)\n\n    o   R CMD Rd2dvi gains a --encoding argument to be passed to\n        R CMD Rdconv, to set the default encoding for conversions.\n        If this is not supplied and the files are package sources and\n        the DESCRIPTION file contains an Encoding field, that is used\n        for the default encoding.\n\n    o   available.packages() (and hence install.packages() etc) now\n        supports subdirectories in a repository, and\n        tools::write_PACKAGES() can now produce PACKAGES files\n        including subdirectories.\n\n    o   The default for 'stylepath' in Sweave's (default) RweaveLatex\n        driver can be set by the environment variable\n        SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT: see ?RweaveLatex.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o   Both the Unix and Windows interfaces for embedding now make\n        use of 'const char *' declarations where appropriate.\n\n    o   Rprintf() and REprintf() now use 'const char *' for their format\n        argument -- this should reduce warnings when called from C++.\n\n    o   There is a new description of the interface for graphics\n        devices in the 'R Internals' manual, and several new entry\n        points.  The API has been updated to version R_GE_version = 5,\n        and graphics devices will need to be updated accordingly.\n\n    o   Graphics devices can now select to be sent text in UTF-8, even\n        if the current locale is not UTF-8 (and so enable text entered\n        in UTF-8 to be plotted).  This is used by postscript(), pdf()\n        and the windows() family of devices, as well as the new\n        cairo-based devices.\n\n    o   More Lapack routines are available (and declared in R_Ext/Lapack.h),\n        notably for (reciprocal) condition number estimation of complex\n        matrices.\n\n    o   Experimental utility R_has_slot supplementing R_do_slot.\n\n    o   There is a new public interface to the encoding info stored on\n        CHARSXPs, getCharCE and mkCharCE using the enumeration type\n        cetype_t.\n\n    o   A new header 'R_ext/Visibility.h' contains some definitions for\n        controlling the visibility of entry points, and how to control\n        visibility is now documented in 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   pt(x, df) is now even more accurate in some cases (e.g. 12 instead\n        of 8 significant digits), when x^2 &lt;&lt; df, thanks to a remark from\n        Ian Smith, related to PR#9945.\n\n    o   co[rv](use = &quot;complete.obs&quot;) now always gives an error if there\n        are no complete cases: they used to give NA if\n        method = &quot;pearson&quot; but an error for the other two methods.\n        (Note that this is pretty arbitrary, but zero-length vectors\n        always give an error so it is at least consistent.)\n\n        cor(use=&quot;pair&quot;) used to give diagonal 1 even if the variable\n        was completely missing for the rank methods but NA for the\n        Pearson method: it now gives NA in all cases.\n\n        cor(use=&quot;pair&quot;) for the rank methods gave a matrix result with\n        dimensions &gt; 0 even if one of the inputs had 0 columns.\n\n    o   Supplying edit.row.names = TRUE when editing a matrix without\n        row names is now an error and not a segfault. (PR#10500)\n\n    o   The error handler in the parser reported unexpected\n        &amp; as &amp;&amp; and | as ||.\n\n    o   ps.options(reset = TRUE) had not reset for a long time.\n\n    o   paste() and file.path() no longer allow NA_character_ for\n        their 'sep' and 'collapse' arguments.\n\n    o   by() failed for 1-column matrices and dataframes.  (PR#10506)\n        However, to preserve the old behaviour, the default method\n        when operating on a vector still passes subsets of the vector\n        to FUN, and this is now documented.\n\n    o   Better behaviour of str.default() for non-default\n        'strict.width' (it was calling str() rather than str.default()\n        internally); also, more useful handling of options(&quot;str&quot;).\n\n    o   wilcox.test(exact=FALSE, conf.int=TRUE) could fail in some\n        extreme two-sample problems.  (Reported by Wolfgang Huber.)\n\n    o   par(pch=) would accept a multi-byte string but only use the\n        first byte.  This would lead to incorrect results in an MBCS\n        locale if a non-ASCII character was supplied.\n\n    o   There are some checks for valid C-style formats in, e.g.\n        png(filename=).  (PR#10571)\n\n    o   vector() was misinterpreting some double 'length' values, e.g,\n        NaN and NA_real_ were interpreted as zero.  Also, invalid\n        types of 'length' were interpreted as -1 and hence reported as\n        negative.  (length&lt;- shared the code and hence the same\n        misinterpretations.)\n\n    o   A basic class &quot;S4&quot; was added to correspond to the &quot;S4&quot; object\n        type, so that objects with this type will print, etc.  The\n        class is VIRTUAL, since all actual S4 objects must have a real\n        class.\n\n    o   Classes with no slots that contain only VIRTUAL classes are now\n        VIRTUAL, as was intended but confused by having an empty S4\n        object as prototype. ## backed out temporarily ##\n\n    o   format.AsIs() discarded dimnames, causing dataframes with matrix\n        variables to be printed without using the column names, unlike\n        what happens in S-PLUS (Tim Hesterberg, PR#10730).\n\n    o   xspline() and grid::grid.xspline() work in device coordinates\n        and now correct for anisotropy in the device coordinate\n        system.\n\n    o   grid.locator() now indicates to the graphics device that it is\n        is in 'graphics input' mode (as locator() and identify()\n        always have).  This means that devices can now indicate the\n        'graphics input' mode by e.g. a change of cursor.\n\n    o   Locales without encoding specification and non-UTF-8 locales\n        now work properly on Mac OS X.  Note that locales without\n        encoding specification always use UTF-8 encoding in Mac OS X\n        (except for specials &quot;POSIX&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) - this is different from\n        other operating systems.\n\n    o   iconv() now correctly handles to=&quot;&quot; and from=&quot;&quot; on Mac OS X.\n\n    o   In diag()'s argument list, drop the explicit default (' = n')\n        for 'ncol' which is ugly when making diag() generic.\n\n    o   S4 classes with the same name from different packages were not\n        recognized because of a bug in caching the new definition.\n\n    o   jpeg() and png() no longer maintain a display list, as they\n        are not interactive devices.\n\n    o   Using attr(x, &quot;names&quot;) &lt;- value (instead of the correct\n        names&lt;-) with 'value' a pairlist (instead of the correct\n        character vector) worked incorrectly.  (PR#10807)\n\n    o   Using [&lt;- to add a column to a data frame dropped other\n        attributes whereas [[&lt;- and $&lt;- did not: now all preserve\n        attributes.  (PR#10873)\n\n    o   File access functions such as file.exists(), file.info(),\n        dirname() and unlink() now treat an NA filename as a\n        non-existent file and not the file &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o   r&lt;foo&gt;(), the random number generators, are now more consistent\n        in warning when NA's (specifically NaN's) are generated.\n\n    o   rnorm(n, mu = Inf) now returns rep(Inf, n) instead of NaN;\n        similar changes are applied to rlnorm(), rexp(), etc.\n\n    o   [l]choose() now warns when rounding non-integer 'k' instead of\n        doing so silently.  (May help confused users such as PR#10766.)\n\n    o   gamma() was warning incorrectly for most negative values as being\n        too near a negative integer.  This also affected other\n        functions making use of its C-level implementation.\n\n    o   dumpMethod() and dumpMethods() now work again.\n\n    o   package.skeleton() now also works for code_files with only\n        metadata (e.g. S4 setClass) definitions; it handles S4 classes and\n        methods, producing documentation and NAMESPACE exports if requested.\n\n    o   Some methods package utilities (implicitGeneric(), makeGeneric())\n        will be more robust in dealing with primitive functions (not a\n        useful idea to call them with primitives, though)\n\n    o   Making a MethodsList from a function with no methods table will\n        return an empty list, rather than cause an error (questionably\n        a bug, but caused some obscure failures).\n\n    o   setAs() now catches 2 arguments in the method definition, if\n        they do not match the arguments of coerce().\n\n    o   S4 methods with missing arguments in the definition are handled\n        correctly  when non-signature arguments exist, and check for\n        conflicting local names in the method definition.\n\n    o   qgamma() and qchisq() could be inaccurate for small p,\n        e.g. qgamma(1.2e-10, shape = 19) was 2.52 rather than 2.73.\n\n    o   dbeta(.., ncp) is now more accurate for large ncp, and typically no\n        longer underflows for give.log = TRUE.\n\n    o   coerce() is now a proper S4 object and so prints correctly.\n\n    o   @ now checks it is being applied to an S4 object, and if not\n        gives a warning (which will become an error in 2.8.0).\n\n    o   dump() and friends now warn that all S4 objects (even those\n        based on vectors) are not source()able, with a stronger wording.\n\n    o   read.dcf(all = TRUE) was leaking connections.\n\n    o   scan() with a non-default separator could skip nul bytes,\n        including those entered as \\0 with allowEscapes=TRUE.  This\n        was different from the default separator.\n\n    o   determinant(matrix(,0,0)) now returns a correct &quot;det&quot; result;\n        also value 1 or 0 depending on 'logarithm', rather than numeric(0).\n\n    o   Name space 'grDevices' was not unloading its DLL when the\n        name space was unloaded.\n\n    o   getNativeSymbolInfo() was unaware of non-registered Fortran\n        names, because one of the C support routines ignored them.\n\n    o   load() again reads correctly character strings with embedded nuls.\n        (This was broken in 2.6.x, but worked in earlier versions.)\n\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.6.2 patched\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   src/extra/pcre has been updated to PCRE 7.6 (bugfix release).\n\n    o   unlink(..., recursive=TRUE) no longer crashes on some platforms\n        if a directory cannot be opened.\n\n    o   Loading in 2.6.2 a saved workspace could give an unimportant\n        warning in a non-UTF-8 multibyte locale (in particular a CJK\n        locale on Windows) which is now suppressed.\n\n    o   print() methods are more consistent in returning the original\n        argument invisibly.\n\n    o   Using the X11 data editor (e.g. via edit(), fix() or View())\n        could crash if the 'End' key was used and all the columns\n        would have fitted into the window.\n\n    o   Creating a new page on an X11() device (by plot.new() or\n        grid.newpage()) did not flush out the XClearWindow call, so\n        the X11 window might not be refreshed immediately.\n\n    o   libtool has been updated to version 1.5.26, which avoids\n        many spurious configure warnings on Darwin/Mac OS X.\n\n    o   l10n_info() now recognizes how Darwin/Mac OS X reports\n        Latin-1 locales (as charset ISO8859-1 rather than ISO-8859-1).\n\n    o   Checking examples which used grid (e.g. via lattice) without\n        attaching grid no longer give errors from grid_plot_hook().\n\n    o   kappa(m, exact=TRUE) no longer wrongly uses 'exact=FALSE' when m\n        is an 'lm' or 'qr' object because the kappa.tri(x, exact=TRUE)\n        now works correctly.\n\n    o   help(topic, offline=TRUE) misbehaved when there were multiple\n        matches to 'topic'.  (PR#10859)\n\n    o   The 'multilib' changes on Linux broke the use of\n        sub-architectures without a main architecture.\n\n    o   source(echo=TRUE) would skip lines consisting entirely of the\n        letter t. (PR#10923)\n\n    o   bzip2 has been updated to 1.0.5 (security fix).\n\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

Instead PR#1959 is handled by a simple error\n        handler which will give an error message in circumstances\n        where none was given before.\n\n    o   The AIC() S4 generic in package stats4 no longer disables\n        dispatch of S3 methods for AIC().\n\n    o   The conflicts check in library() excluded all S4 generics, even\n        where they were unrelated to the function masked.  It is now\n        more selective (although still too generous to S4 generics).\n\n    o   proc.time() was missing a protect and could misbehave if\n        provoked by gctorture().  (PR#10600)\n\n    o   The cut() and hist() methods for dates and datetimes are now\n        more accurate for intervals of &quot;months&quot; and &quot;years&quot;, thanks to\n        Marc Schwarz.\n\n    o   url()/download.file() could segfault if the HTTP interaction\n        involved a redirect to an address starting with '/' on the\n        same server.\n\n    o   Memory allocations used in format() and in an internal utility\n        function could be off by one byte. (PR#10635)\n\n    o   isoreg(x, y) no longer segfaults when y has NAs.\n\n    o   split(x, g) always returns a list as documented.  (It used to\n        return NULL for a zero-length 'x'.)\n\n    o   tapply(x, g, ...) misbehaved if the args were of zero length.\n        (PR#10644)\n\n    o   hist.POSIXt(*, xaxt = &quot;n&quot;) no longer suppresses the y-axis.\n\n    o   strptime() crashed under certain locales on Mac OS X.\n\n    o   gregexpr() no longer segfaults when &quot;&quot; is given as the search\n        pattern.  Thanks to Herve Pages for the bug report.\n\n    o   matplot(x, *) with default 'pch' did not plot columns from column\n        number 37 on (because the default pch was NA for those). (PR#10676)\n\n    o   print.htest() lost output when used within sink(file, split=TRUE).\n\n    o   Setting par(col.main=) also set par(&quot;col&quot;) to the same colour.\n\n    o   Anonymous fifos were broken (again).\n\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

Thanks to\n        Michael Lawrence for diagnosis and patch.\n\n    o   object.size() had slightly too low a size for objects of type &quot;S4&quot;.\n\n    o   symbol() in plotmath expressions was only accepting valid\n        character strings, which made it impossible to specify symbols\n        such as aleph (obtained by symbol(&quot;\\300&quot;)) in a UTF-8 locale.\n\n    o   An event handling issue caused autorepeat functions to\n        misbehave with tcltk (notably scrollbars).\n\n    o   plot(sin, -5, 5) gives ylab 'sin(x)' again, where it resulted\n        in 'x(x)' in 2.6.0.  Further,  plot(sin)  again plots from\n        [0,1] also in cases where a previously used coordinate system\n        differs.\n\n    o   curve() with unspecified 'from', 'to' and 'xlim' now reuses the\n        previous x limits, and not slightly larger ones.\n\n    o   It was intended that R code filenames in packages should start\n        with an ASCII letter or digits (and R CMD INSTALL uses that),\n        but the test used in R CMD build ([A-Za-z0-9]) was\n        locale-specific (and excluded t to y in Estonian, for\n        example).  (PR#10351)\n\n    o   'R CMD build' could misbehave when faced with files with CRLF\n        line endings *and* no line ending on the final line of the\n        file, removing the last byte of the file.\n\n    o   DF[i, j] failed in 2.6.0 if j was a logical vector selecting a\n        single column.\n\n    o   Unix x11() would fail if a valid 'display' was specified but\n        DISPLAY was unset. (PR#10379)\n\n    o   postscript() was not always ignoring .Postscript.Options in\n        the workspace (where it should not have occurred).\n\n    o   help.search() would give an error if it found a badly\n        installed package, even if 'package' was not specified.\n\n    o   tclServiceMode() (package tcltk) now works under Unix-alikes.\n        (Although documented, it used only to work under Windows.)\n\n    o   As Mac OS X 10.5.0 comes with incompatible /bin/sh shell, we\n        force SHELL=/bin/bash (which is ok) in that case. [Only for\n        2.6.x: another solution is used in 2.7.0.]\n\n    o   Deliberately using malformed source attributes no longer\n        causes deparsing/printing of functions to crash R. (PR#10437)\n\n    o   R CMD check and R CMD INSTALL now work with (some) directory\n        names containing spaces.\n\n    o   choose(n, k) gave incorrect values for negative n and small k.\n\n    o   plot.ts(x,y) could use wrong default labels; fixed thanks to\n        Antonio, Fabio di Narzo.\n\n    o   reshape() got column names out of sync with contents in some\n        cases; found by Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo.\n\n    o   ar(x) for short 'x' (i.e. length &lt;= 10) could fail because the\n        default 'order.max' was &gt;= length(x) which is non-sensical.\n\n    o   Keyboard events in getGraphicsEvent() could cause stack\n        imbalance errors (PR#10453)\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

This\n        reduces the chances of unintentional partial matching but\n        means that the later arguments must be named in full.\n\n    o   The default type for nchar() is now &quot;chars&quot;.  This is almost\n        always what was intended, and differs from the previous default\n        only for non-ASCII strings in a MBCS locale.  There is a new\n        argument 'allowNA', and the default behaviour is now to throw\n        an error on an invalid multibyte string if type=&quot;chars&quot; or\n        type=&quot;width&quot;.\n\n    o   Connections will be closed if there is no R object referring to\n        them.  A warning is issued if this is done, either at garbage\n        collection or if all the connection slots are in use.\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   abs(), sign(), sqrt(), floor(), ceiling(), exp() and the gamma,\n        trig and hyperbolic trig functions now only accept one\n        argument even when dispatching to a Math group method (which\n        may accept more than one argument for other group members).\n\n    o   abbreviate() gains a 'method' argument with a new option\n        &quot;both.sides&quot; which can make shorter abbreviations.\n\n    o   aggregate.data.frame() no longer changes the group variables\n        into factors, and leaves alone the levels of those which are\n        factors.  (Inter alia grants the wish of PR#9666.)\n\n    o   The default 'max.names' in all.names() and all.vars() is now\n        -1 which means unlimited.  This fixes PR#9873.\n\n    o   as.vector() and the default methods of as.character(),\n        as.complex(), as.double(), as.expression(), as.integer(),\n        as.logical() and as.raw() no longer duplicate in most cases\n        where the object is unchanged.  (Beware: some code has been\n        written that invalidly assumes that they do duplicate, often\n        when using .C/.Fortran(DUP=FALSE).)\n\n    o   as.complex(), as.double(), as.integer(), as.logical() and\n        as.raw() are now primitive and internally generic for\n        efficiency. They no longer dispatch on S3 methods for\n        as.vector() (which was never documented).  as.real() and\n        as.numeric() remain as alternative names for as.double().\n\n        expm1(), log(), log1p(), log2(), log10(), gamma(), lgamma(),\n        digamma() and trigamma() are now primitive.  (Note that logb()\n        is not.)\n\n        The Math2 and Summary groups (round, signif, all, any, max, min,\n        summ, prod, range) are now primitive.\n\n        See under METHODS PACKAGE below for some consquences for S4 methods.\n\n    o   apropos() now sorts by name and not by position on the search\n        path.\n\n    o   attr() gains an 'exact = TRUE' argument to disable partial\n        matching.\n\n    o   bxp() now allows 'xlim' to be specified. (PR#9754)\n\n    o   C(f, SAS) now works in the same way as C(f, treatment), etc.\n\n    o   chol() is now generic.\n\n    o   dev2bitmap() has a new option to go via PDF and so allow\n        semi-transparent colours to be used.\n\n    o   dev.interactive() regards devices with the displaylist enabled\n        as interactive, and packages can register the names of their\n        devices as interactive via deviceIsInteractive().\n\n    o   download.packages() and available.packages() (and functions\n        which use them) now support in 'repos' or 'contriburl' either\n        file: plus a general path (including drives on a UNC path on\n        Windows) or a <A HREF=\"file:///\">file:///</A> URL in the same way as url().\n\n    o   dQuote() and sQuote() are more flexible, with rendering\n        controlled by the new option 'useFancyQuotes'.  This includes\n        the ability to have TeX-style rendering and directional quotes\n        (the so-called 'smart quotes') on Windows.  The default is to\n        use directional quotes in UTF-8 locales (as before) and in the\n        Rgui console on Windows (new).\n\n    o   duplicated() and unique() and their methods in base gain an\n        additional argument 'fromLast'.\n    o   fifo() no longer has a default 'description' argument.\n\n        fifo(&quot;&quot;) is now implemented, and works in the same way as file(&quot;&quot;).\n\n    o   file.edit() and file.show() now tilde-expand file paths on all\n        interfaces (they used to on some and not others).\n\n    o   The find() argument is now named 'numeric' and not 'numeric.':\n        the latter was needed to avoid warnings about name clashes\n        many years ago, but partial matching was used.\n\n    o   stats:::.getXlevels() confines attention to factors since some\n        users expected R to treat unclass(&lt;a factor&gt;) as a numeric\n        vector.\n\n    o   grep(), strsplit() and friends now warn if incompatible sets\n        of options are used, instead of silently using the documented\n        priority.\n\n    o   gsub()/sub() with perl = TRUE now preserves attributes from the\n        argument x on the result.\n\n    o   is.finite() and is.infinite() are now S3 and S4 generic.\n\n    o   jpeg(), png(), bmp() (Windows), dev2bitmap() and bitmap() have\n        a new argument 'units' to specify the units of 'width' and\n        'height'.\n\n    o   levels() is now generic (levels&lt;- has been for a long time).\n\n    o   Loading serialized raw objects with load() is now considerably\n        faster.\n\n    o   New primitive nzchar() as a faster alternative to\n        nchar(x) &gt; 0 (and avoids having to convert to wide chars in\n        a MBCS locale and hence consider validity).\n\n    o   The way old.packages() and hence update.packages() handle\n        packages with different versions in multiple package\n        repositories has been changed.  The first package encountered\n        was selected, now the one with highest version number.\n\n    o   optim(method = &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;) now accepts zero-length parameters,\n        like the other methods.  Also, method = &quot;SANN&quot; no longer\n        attempts to optimize in this case.\n\n    o   New options 'showWarnCalls' and 'showErrorCalls' to give a\n        concise traceback on warnings and errors.  showErrorCalls=TRUE\n        is the default for non-interactive sessions.  Option\n        'showNCalls' controls how abbreviated the call sequence is.\n\n    o   New options 'warnPartialMatchDollar', 'warnPartialMatchArgs'\n        and 'warnPartialMatchAttr' to help detect the unintended use\n        of partial matching in $, argument matching and attr()\n        respectively.\n\n    o   A device named as a character string in options(device =) is now\n        looked for in the grDevices name space if it is not visible\n        from the global environment.\n\n    o   pmatch(x, y, duplicates.ok = TRUE) now uses hashing and so is\n        much faster for large x and y when most matches are exact.\n\n    o   qr() is now generic.\n\n    o   It is now a warning to have an non-integer object for\n        .Random.seed: this indicates a user had been playing with it,\n        and it has always been documented that users should only save\n        and restore it.\n\n    o   New higher-order functions Reduce(), Filter() and Map().\n\n    o   [g]regexpr() gain an 'ignore.case' argument for consistency with\n        grep().  (This does change the positional matching\n        of arguments, but no instances of positional matching beyond\n        the second were found.)\n\n    o   relist() utility, an S3 generic with several methods, providing\n        an 'inverse' for unlist(); thanks to a code proposal from\n        Andrew Clausen.\n\n    o   require() now returns invisibly.\n\n    o   The interface to reshape() has been revised, allowing some\n        simplified forms that did not work before, and somewhat\n        improved error handling. A new argument 'sep' has been\n        introduced to replace simple usages of 'split' (the old\n        features are retained).\n\n    o   rmultinom() uses a high-precision accumulator where available,\n        and so is more likely to give the same result on different\n        platforms (although it is still possible to get different\n        results, and the result may differ from previous versions of R).\n\n    o   row() and col() now work on matrix-like objects such as data\n        frames, not just matrices.\n\n    o   Rprof() allows smaller values of 'interval' on machines that\n        support it: for example modern Linux systems support\n        interval = 0.001.\n\n    o   sample() now requires its first argument 'x' to be numeric\n        (in the sense of is.numeric()) as well as of length 1 and &gt;= 1\n        before it is regarded as shorthand for 1:x.\n\n    o   sessionInfo() now provides details about package name spaces\n        that are loaded but not attached.  The output of sessionInfo\n        has been improved to make it easier to read when it is\n        inadvertently wrapped after being pasted into an email\n        message.\n\n    o   setRepositories() has a new argument 'ind' to allow selections\n        to be made programmatically.\n\n    o   showMethods() has a &quot;smart&quot; default for 'inherited' such that\n        showMethods(&lt;genfun&gt;, incl = TRUE)  becomes a useful short cut.\n\n    o   sprintf() no longer has a output string length limit.\n\n    o   storage.mode&lt;- is now primitive, and hence makes fewer copies\n        of an object (none if the mode is unchanged).  It is a little\n        less general than mode&lt;-, which remains available.  (See also\n        the entry under DEFUNCT below.)\n\n    o   sweep() gains an argument 'check.margin = TRUE' which warns\n        about mismatched dimensions.\n\n    o   The mathematical annotation facility (plotmath) now recognises\n        a symbol() function which forces the font to be a symbol font.\n        This allows access to all characters in the Adobe Symbol\n        encoding within plotmath expressions.\n\n    o   For OSes that cannot unset environment variables, Sys.unsetenv()\n        sets the value to &quot;&quot;, with a warning.\n\n    o   New function Sys.which(), an interface to 'which' on\n        Unix-alikes and an emulation on Windows.\n\n    o   On Unix-alikes, system(, intern = TRUE) reports on very long\n        lines that may be truncated, giving the line number of the\n        content being read.\n\n    o   termplot() has a default for 'ask' that uses dev.interactive().\n\n        It allows 'ylim' to be set, or computed to cover all the\n        plots to be made (the new default) or computed for each plot\n        (the previous default).\n\n    o   uniroot(f, *) is slightly faster for non-trivial f() because it\n        computes f(lower) and f(upper) only once, and it has new optional\n        arguments 'f.lower' and 'f.upper' by which the caller can pass these.\n\n    o   unlink() is now internal, using common POSIX code on all platforms.\n\n    o   unsplit() now works with lists of dataframes.\n\n    o   The vcov() methods for classes &quot;gls&quot; and &quot;nlme&quot; have migrated to\n        package 'nlme'.\n\n    o   vignette() has a new argument 'all' to choose between showing\n        vignettes in attached packages or in all installed packages.\n\n    o   New function within(), which is like with(), except that it\n        returns modified versions back of lists and data frames.\n\n    o   X11(), postscript() (and hence bitmap()), xfig(), jpeg(), png()\n        and the Windows devices win.print(), win.metafile() and bmp()\n        now warn (once at first use) if semi-transparent colours are\n        used (rather than silently treating them as fully\n        transparent).\n\n    o   New function xspline() to provide base graphics support of\n        X-splines (cf grid.xspline).\n\n    o   New function xyTable() does the 2D gridding &quot;computations&quot; used by\n        sunflowerplot().\n\n    o   Rd conversion to HTML and CHM now makes use of classes, which\n        are set in the stylesheets.  Editing R.css will change the\n        styles used for \\env, \\option, \\pkg etc.  (CHM styles are set\n        at compilation time.)\n\n    o   The documented arguments of '%*%' have been changed to be x\n        and y, to match S and the implicit S4 generic.\n\n    o   If members of the Ops group (the arithmetic, logical and\n        comparison operators) and '%*%' are called as functions,\n        e.g. '&gt;'(x, y), positional matching is always used.  (It used\n        to be the case that positional matching was used for the\n        default methods, but names would be matched for S3 and S4\n        methods and in the case of '!' the argument name differed\n        between S3 and S4 methods.)\n\n    o   Imports environments of name spaces are named (as\n        &quot;imports:foo&quot;), and so are known e.g. to environmentName().\n\n    o   Package 'stats4' uses lazy-loading not SaveImage (which is now\n        deprecated).\n\n    o   Installing help for a package now parses the .Rd file only\n        once, rather than once for each type.\n\n    o   PCRE has been updated to version 7.2.\n\n    o   bzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.4.\n\n    o   gettext has been updated to version 0.16.1.\n\n    o   There is now a global CHARSXP cache, R_StringHash.  CHARSXPs\n        are no longer duplicated and must not be modified in place.\n        Developers should strive to only use mkChar (and mkString) for\n        creating new CHARSXPs and avoid use of allocString.  A new\n        macro, CallocCharBuf, can be used to obtain a temporary char\n        buffer for manipulating character data.  This patch was\n        written by Seth Falcon.\n\n    o   The internal equivalents of as.complex, as.double, as.integer\n        and as.logical used to handle length-1 arguments now accept\n        character strings (rather than report that this is\n        'unimplemented').\n\n    o   Lazy-loading a package is now substantially more efficient (in\n        memory saved and load time).\n\n    o   Various performance improvements lead to a 45% reduction\n        in the startup time without 'methods' (and one-sixth with -\n        'methods' now takes 75% of the startup time of a default session).\n\n    o   The [[ subsetting operator now has an argument 'exact' that\n        allows programmers to disable partial matching (which will in\n        due course become the default).  The default value is exact=NA\n        which causes a warning to be issued when partial matching\n        occurs.  When exact = TRUE, no partial matching will be\n        performed.  When exact = FALSE, partial matching can occur and\n        no warning will be issued.  This patch was written by Seth\n        Falcon.\n\n    o   Many of the C-level warning / error messages (e.g. from\n        subscripting) have been re-worked to give more detailed\n        information on either the location or the cause of the\n        problem.\n\n    o   The S3 and S4 Math groups have been harmonized.  Functions\n        log1p(), expm1(), log10() and log2() are members of the S3\n        group, and sign(), log1p(), expm1(), log2(), cummax(),\n        cummin(), digamma(), trigamma() and trunk() are members of the\n        S4 group.  gammaCody() is no longer in the S3 Math group.\n        They are now all primitive.\n\n    o   The initialization of the random-number stream makes use of the\n        sub-second part of the current time where available.\n\n        Initialization of the 1997 Knuth TAOCP generator is now done\n        in R code, avoiding some C code whose licence status has been\n        questioned.\n\n    o   The reporting of syntax errors has been made more user-\n        friendly.\n\nMETHODS PACKAGE\n\n    o   Packages using 'methods' have to have been installed in R 2.4.0\n        or later (when various internal representations were changed).\n\n    o   Internally generic primitives no longer dispatch S4 methods on\n        S3 objects.\n\n    o   load() and restoring a workspace attempt to detect and warn on\n        the loading of pre-2.4.0 S4 objects.\n\n    o   Making functions primitive changes the semantics of S4\n        dispatch: these no longer dispatch on classes based on types\n        but do dispatch whenever the function in the base name space is\n        called.\n\n        This applies to as.complex(), as.integer(), as.logical(),\n        as.numeric(), as.raw(), expm1(), log(), log1p(), log2(),\n        log10(), gamma(), lgamma(), digamma() and trigamma(), as\n        well as the Math2 and Summary groups.\n\n        Because all members of the group generics are now primitive,\n        they are all S4 generic and setting an S4 group generic does\n        at last apply to all members and not just those already made\n        S4 generic.\n\n        as.double() and as.real() are identical to as.numeric(), and\n        now remain so even if S4 methods are set on any of them.\n        Since 'as.numeric' is the traditional name used in S4,\n        currently methods must be exported from a NAMESPACE for\n        'as.numeric' only.\n\n    o   The S4 generic for '!' has been changed to have signature (x)\n        (was (e1)) to match the documentation and the S3 generic.\n        setMethod() will fix up methods defined for (e1), with a\n        warning.\n\n    o   The &quot;structure&quot; S4 class now has methods that implement the\n        concept of structures as described in the Blue Book--that\n        element-by-element functions and operators leave structure\n        intact unless they change the length.  The informal behavior\n        of R for vectors with attributes was inconsistent.\n\n    o   The implicitGeneric() function and relatives have been added to\n        specify how a function in a package should look when methods are\n        defined for it.  This will be used to ensure that generic versions\n        of functions in R core are consistent.  See ?implicitGeneric.\n\n    o   Error messages generated by some of the functions in the methods\n        package provide the name of the generic to provide more\n        contextual information.\n\n    o   It is now possible to use setGeneric(useAsDefault = FALSE) to\n        define a new generic with the name of a primitive function\n        (but having no connection with the primitive).\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   $ on an atomic vector now gives a warning that it is 'invalid'.\n        It remains deprecated, but may be removed in R &gt;= 2.7.0.\n\n    o   storage.mode(x) &lt;- &quot;real&quot; and storage.mode(x) &lt;- &quot;single&quot; are\n        defunct: use instead storage.mode(x) &lt;- &quot;double&quot; and\n        mode(x) &lt;- &quot;single&quot;.\n\n    o   In package installation, SaveImage: yes is deprecated in\n        favour of LazyLoad: yes.\n\n    o   seemsS4Object (methods package) is deprecated in favour of isS4().\n\n    o   It is planned that [[exact=TRUE]] will become the default in\n        R 2.7.0.\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o   checkS3methods() (invoked by R CMD check) now checks the\n        arguments of methods for primitive members of the S3 group\n        generics.\n\n    o   R CMD check now does a recursive copy on the 'tests' directory.\n\n    o   R CMD check now warns on non-ASCII .Rd files without an\n        \\encoding field, rather than just on ones that are definitely\n        not from an ISO-8859 encoding.  This agrees with the\n        long-standing stipulation in 'Writing R Extensions', and\n        catches some packages with UTF-8 man pages.\n\n    o   R CMD check now warns on DESCRIPTION files with a non-portable\n        Encoding field, or with non-ASCII data and no Encoding field.\n\n    o   R CMD check now loads all the 'Suggests' and 'Enhances'\n        dependencies to reduce warnings about non-visible objects, and\n        also emulates standard functions (such as shell()) on\n        alternative R platforms.\n\n    o   R CMD check now (by default) attempts to latex the vignettes\n        rather than just weave and tangle them: this will give a NOTE\n        if there are latex errors.\n\n    o   R CMD check computations no longer ignore Rd \\usage entries for\n        functions for extracting or replacing parts of an object, so S3\n        methods should use the appropriate \\method{} markup.\n\n    o   R CMD check now checks for CR (as well as CRLF) line endings in\n        C/C++/Fortran source files, and for non-LF line endings in\n        Makefile[.in] and Makevars[.in] in the package 'src'\n        directory.  R CMD build will correct non-LF line endings in\n        source files and in the make files mentioned.\n\n    o   Rdconv now warns about unmatched braces rather than silently\n        omitting sections containing them.  (Suggestion by Bill\n        Dunlap, PR#9649)\n\n        Rdconv now renders (rather than ignores) \\var{} inside \\code{}\n        markup in latex conversion.\n\n        R CMD  Rdconv gains a --encoding argument to set the default\n        encoding for conversions.\n\n    o   The list of CRAN mirrors now has a new (manually maintained)\n        column &quot;OK&quot; which flags mirrors that seem to be OK, only those\n        are used by chooseCRANmirror(). The now exported function\n        getCRANmirrors() can be used to get all known mirrors or only\n        the ones that are OK.\n\n    o   R CMD SHLIB gains arguments --clean and --preclean to clean up\n        intermediate files after and before building.\n\n    o   R CMD config now knows about FC and FCFLAGS (used for F9x\n        compilation).\n\n    o   R CMD Rdconv now does a better job of rendering quotes in\n        titles in HTML, and \\sQuote and \\dQuote into text on Windows.\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o   New utility function alloc3DArray similar to allocMatrix.\n\n    o   The entry point R_seemsS4Object in Rinternals.h has not been\n        needed since R 2.4.0 and has been removed.  Use IS_S4_OBJECT\n        instead.\n\n    o   Applications embedding R can use R_getEmbeddingDllInfo() to\n        obtain DllInfo for registering symbols present in the\n        application itself.\n\n    o   The instructions for making and using standalone libRmath have\n        been moved to the R Installation and Administration manual.\n\n    o   CHAR() now returns (const char *) since CHARSXPs should no\n        longer be modified in place.  This change allows compilers to\n        warn or error about improper modification.  Thanks to Herve\n        Pages for the suggestion.\n\n    o   acopy_string is a (provisional) new helper function that\n        copies character data and returns a pointer to memory\n        allocated using R_alloc.  This can be used to create a copy of\n        a string stored in a CHARSXP before passing the data on to a\n        function that modifies its arguments.\n\n    o   asLogical, asInteger, asReal and asComplex now accept STRSXP\n        and CHARSXP arguments, and asChar accepts CHARSXP.\n\n    o   New R_GE_str2col() exported via R_ext/GraphicsEngine.h for\n        external device developers.\n\n    o   doKeybd and doMouseevent are now exported in GraphicsDevice.h.\n\n    o   R_alloc now has first argument of type 'size_t' to support\n        64-bit platforms (e.g. Win64) with a 32-bit 'long' type.\n\n    o   The type of the last two arguments of getMatrixDimnames (non-API\n        but mentioned in R-exts.texi and in Rinternals.h) has been\n        changed to 'const char **' (from char **).\n\n    o   R_FINITE now always resolves to the function call R_finite in\n        packages (rather than sometimes substituting isfinite).  This\n        avoids some issues where R headers are called from C++ code\n        using features tested on the C compiler.\n\n    o   The advice to include R headers from C++ inside extern &quot;C&quot; {}\n        has been changed.  It is nowadays better *not* to wrap the\n        headers, as they include other headers which on some OSes\n        should not be wrapped.\n\n    o   Rinternals.h no longer includes a substantial set of C headers.\n        All but ctype.h and errno.h are included by R.h which is supposed\n        to be used before Rinternals.h.\n\n    o   Including C system headers can be avoided by defining NO_C_HEADERS\n        before including R headers.  This is intended to be used from\n        C++ code, and you will need to include C++ equivalents such as\n        &lt;cmath&gt; before the R headers.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   The 'test-Lapack' test is now part of 'make check'.\n\n    o   The 'stat' system call is now required, along with 'opendir'\n        (which had long been used but not tested for).  ('make check'\n        would have failed in earlier versions without these calls.)\n\n    o   'evince' is now considered as a possible PDF viewer.\n\n    o   'make install-strip' now also strips the DLLs in the standard\n        packages.\n\n    o   Perl 5.8.0 (released in July 2002) or later is now required.\n        (R 2.4.0 and later have in fact required 5.6.1 or later.)\n\n    o   The C function 'finite' is no longer used: we expect a C99\n        compiler which will have 'isfinite'.  (If that is missing, we\n        test separately for NaN, Inf and -Inf.)\n\n    o   A script/executable 'texi2dvi' is now required on Unix-alikes:\n        it is part of the texinfo distribution.\n\n    o   Files texinfo.tex and txi-en.tex are no longer supplied in\n        doc/manual (as the latest versions have an incompatible\n        licence).  You will need to ensure that your texinfo and/or\n        TeX installations supply them.\n\n    o   wcstod is now required for MBCS support.\n\n    o   There are some experimental provisions for building on Cygwin.\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION\n\n    o   The encoding declared in the DESCRIPTION file is now used as\n        the default encoding for .Rd files.\n\n    o   A standard for specifying package license information in the\n        DESCRIPTION License field was introduced, see 'Writing R\n        Extensions'.  In addition, files LICENSE or LICENCE in a package\n        top-level source directory are now installed (so putting copies\n        into the 'inst' subdirectory is no longer necessary).\n\n    o   install.packages() on a Unix-alike now updates\n        doc/html/packages.html only if packages are installed to\n        .Library (by that exact name).\n\n    o   R CMD INSTALL --clean now runs SHLIB --clean to do the clean\n        up (unless there is a src/Makefile), and this will remove\n        $(OBJECTS) (which might have been redefined in Makevars).\n\n        R CMD INSTALL --preclean cleans up the sources after a\n        previous installation (as if that had used --clean) before\n        attempting to install.\n\n        R CMD INSTALL will now run R CMD SHLIB in the 'src' directory\n        if src/Makevars is present, even if there are no source files\n        with known extensions.\n\n    o   If there is a file src/Makefile, src/Makevars is now ignored\n        (it could be included by src/Makefile if desired), and it is\n        preceded by etc/Makeconf rather than share/make/shlib.mk.\n        Thus the makefiles read are R_HOME/etc/Makeconf, src/Makefile\n        in the package and then any personal Makevars files.\n\n    o   R CMD SHLIB used to support the use of 'OBJS' in Makevars, but\n        this was changed to 'OBJECTS' in 2001.  The undocumented\n        alternative of 'OBJS' has finally been removed.\n\n    o   R CMD check no longer issues a warning about no data sets\n        being present if a lazyload db is found (as determined by the\n        presence of Rdata.rdb, Rdata.rds, and Rdata.rdx in the 'data'\n        subdirectory.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   charmatch() and pmatch() used to accept non-integer values for\n        'nomatch' even though the return value was documented to be\n        integer.  Now 'nomatch' is coerced to integer (rather than the\n        result being coerced to the type of 'nomatch').\n\n    o   match.call() no longer 'works' outside a function unless\n        'definition' is supplied.  (Under some circumstances it used\n        to 'work', matching itself.)\n\n    o   The formula methods of boxplot, cdplot, pairs and spineplot\n        now attach 'stats' so that model.frame() is visible where\n        they evaluate it.\n\n    o   Date-time objects are no longer regarded as numeric by\n        is.numeric().\n\n    o   methods(&quot;Math&quot;) did not work if 'methods' was not attached.\n\n    o   readChar() read an extra empty item (or more than one) beyond\n        the end of the source; in some conditions it would terminate\n        early when reading an item of length 0.\n\n    o   Added a promise evaluation stack so interrupted promise\n        evaluations can be restarted.\n\n    o   R.version[1:10] now nicely prints.\n\n    o   In the methods package, prototypes are now inherited for the\n        .Data &quot;slot&quot;; i.e., for classes that contain one of the basic\n        data types.\n\n    o   &lt;data frame&gt;[[i, j]] now works if 'i' is character.\n\n    o   write.dcf() no longer writes NA fields (PR#9796), and works\n        correctly on empty descriptions.\n\n    o   pbeta(x, log.p = TRUE) now has improved accuracy in many cases,\n        and so have functions depending on it such as pt(), pf() and\n        pbinom().\n\n    o   mle() had problems with the L-BFGS-B in the no-parameter case\n        and consequentially also when profiling 1-parameter models\n        (fix thanks to Ben Bolker).\n\n    o   Two bugs fixed in methods that in involve the &quot;...&quot; argument in\n        the generic function: previously failed to catch methods that\n        just dropped the &quot;...&quot;; and use of callGeneric() with no arguments\n        failed in some circumstances when &quot;...&quot; was a formal argument.\n\n    o   sequence() now behaves more reasonably, although not\n        back-compatibly for zero or negative input.\n\n    o   nls() now allows more peculiar but reasonable ways of being called,\n        e.g., with data=list(&lt;uneven lengths&gt;) or a model without variables.\n\n    o   match.arg() was not behaving as documented when\n        several.ok=TRUE (PR#9859), gave spurious warnings when 'arg'\n        had the wrong length and was incorrectly documented (exact\n        matches are returned even when there is more than one partial\n        match).\n\n    o   The data.frame method for split&lt;-() was broken.\n\n    o   The test for -D__NO_MATH_INLINES was badly broken and returned\n        true on all non-glibc platforms and false on all glibc ones\n        (whether they were broken or not).\n\n    o   LF was missing after the last prompt when --quiet was used without\n        --slave. Use --slave when no final LF is desired.\n\n    o   Fixed bug in initialisation code in 'grid' package for\n        determining the boundaries of shapes.  Problem reported\n        by Hadley Wickham;  symptom was error message:\n        &quot;Polygon edge not found&quot;.\n\n    o   str() is no longer slow for large POSIXct objects.  Its output\n        is also slightly more compact for such objects; implementation\n        via new optional argument 'give.head'.\n\n    o   strsplit(*, fixed=TRUE), potentially iconv() and internal string\n        formatting is now faster for large strings, thanks to report\n        PR#9902 by John Brzustowski.\n\n    o   de.restore() gave a spurious warning for matrices (Ben Bolker)\n\n    o   plot(fn, xlim=c(a,b)) would not set &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; properly\n        when plotting a function.  The argument lists to curve() and\n        plot.function() have been modified slightly as part of the\n        fix.\n\n    o   julian() was documented to work with POSIXt origins, but did\n        not work with POSIXlt ones.  (PR#9908)\n\n    o   Dataset HairEyeColor has been corrected to agree with\n        Friendly (2000): the change involves the breakdown of the\n        Brown hair / Brown eye cell by Sex, and only totals over Sex\n        are given in the original source.\n\n    o   Trailing spaces are now consistently stripped from \\alias{}\n        entries in .Rd files, and this is now documented.  (PR#9915)\n\n    o   .find.packages(), packageDescription() and sessionInfo()\n        assumed that attached environments named &quot;package:foo&quot; were\n        package environments, although misguided users could use such\n        a name in attach().\n\n    o   spline() and splinefun() with method = &quot;periodic&quot; could return\n        incorrect results when length(x) was 2 or 3.\n\n    o   getS3method() could fail if the method name contained a regexp\n        metacharacter such as &quot;+&quot;.\n\n    o   help(&lt;a character vector&gt;) now uses the name and not the\n        value of the vector unless it has length exactly one, so\n        e.g. help(letters) now gives help on 'letters'.\n        (Related to PR#9927)\n\n    o   Ranges in chartr() now work better in CJK locales, thanks to\n        Ei-ji Nakama.\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

The default now allows filename-completion\n        with +-* in the filenames.\n\n    o   If the srcfile argument to parse() is not NULL, it will be added\n        to the result as a &quot;srcfile&quot; attribute.\n\n    o   It is no longer possible to interrupt lazy-loading (which was\n        only at all likely when lazy-loading environments), which\n        would leave the object being loaded in an unusable state.\n        This is a temporary measure: error-recovery when evaluating\n        promises will be tackled more comprehensively in 2.6.0.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o   'make check' will work with --without-iconv, to accommodate\n        building on AIX where the system iconv conflicts with\n        libiconv and is not compatible with R's requirements.\n\n    o   There is support for 'DESTDIR': see the R-admin manual.\n\n    o   The texinfo manuals are now converted to HTML with a style\n        sheet: in recent versions of makeinfo the markup such as @file\n        was being lost in the HTML rendering.\n\n    o   The use of inlining has been tweaked to avoid warnings from\n        gcc &gt;= 4.2.0 when compiling in C99 mode (which is the default\n        from configure).\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   as.dendrogram() failed on objects of class &quot;dendrogram&quot;.\n\n    o   plot(type =&quot;s&quot;) (or &quot;S&quot;) with many (hundreds of thousands)\n        of points could overflow the stack.  (PR#9629)\n\n    o   Coercing an S4 classed object to &quot;matrix&quot; (or other basic class)\n        failed to unset the S4 bit.\n\n    o   The 'useS4' argument of print.default() had been broken by an\n        unrelated change prior to 2.4.1.  This allowed print() and\n        show() to bounce badly constructed S4 objects between\n        themselves indefinitely.\n\n    o   Prediction of the seasonal component in HoltWinters() was one\n        step out at one point in the calculations.\n\n        decompose() incorrectly computed the 'random' component for a\n        multiplicative fit.\n\n    o   Wildcards work again in unlink() on Unix-alikes (they did not\n        in 2.5.0).\n\n    o   When qr() used pivoting, the coefficient names in qr.coef() were\n        not pivoted to match.  (PR#9623)\n\n    o   UseMethod() could crash R if the first argument was not a\n        character string.\n\n    o   R and Rscript on Unix-alikes were not accepting spaces in -e\n        arguments (even if quoted).\n\n    o   Hexadecimal integer constants (e.g. 0x10L) were not being parsed\n        correctly on platforms where the C function atof did not\n        accept hexadecimal prefixes (as required by C99, but not\n        implemented in MinGW as used by R on Windows).  (PR#9648)\n\n    o   libRlapack.dylib on Mac OS X had no version information and\n        sometimes an invalid identification name.\n\n    o   Rd conversion of \\usage treated '\\\\' as a single backslash in\n        all but latex: it now acts consistently with the other\n        verbatim-like environments (it was never 'verbatim' despite\n        the documentation).\n\n        \\code{\\.} is now rendered as '\\.' in all formats, as\n        documented (it was not the case for latex conversion).\n\n        codoc() (and checkDocStyle() and checkDocUsage()) now apply\n        the same transformations to \\usage as Rd conversion does,\n        so {, % and \\\\ in strings in usages will now be related\n        correctly to the help files.\n\n    o   rbind() failed if the only data frame had 0 rows. (PR#9657)\n\n    o   &lt;a data.frame&gt;[i, j] could sometimes select the wrong column\n        when j is numeric if there are duplicate column names.\n\n    o   sample(x, size, replace=TRUE, prob) had a memory leak if\n        10000 &lt; size &lt;= 100000.\n\n    o   x &lt;- cbind(1:2); rownames(x) &lt;- factor(c(&quot;A&quot;,NA))  now longer\n        segfaults.\n\n    o   R CMD BATCH no longer assumes Sys.unsetenv() is supported (it\n        is not on older Solaris systems).\n\n    o   median() returned a logical result when it was 'NA': it now\n        returns an NA of appropriate type (e.g. integer or double).\n\n    o   grep(fixed = TRUE, perl = TRUE) ignored 'fixed', although it\n        was documented to ignore 'perl'\n        Same for [g]regexpr and [g]sub.\n\n    o   getNamespaceExports(&quot;base&quot;) works again.\n\n    o   runmed(c(), 1) no longer segfaults.\n\n    o   qr.coef(QR, b) failed for an LAPACK-produced QR if b was\n        integer or for an over-determined system.\n\n        qr.solve() for an under-determined system produces a\n        solution with 0 and not NA for columns which are unused.\n\n    o   segments() was not handling full transparency correctly in PDF.\n        (PR#9694)\n\n        Nor was arrows().\n\n    o   callGeneric() inside a method with extra arguments {and hence\n        currently defined via .local()} now works.\n\n    o   [g]sub(fixed=TRUE, useBytes=FALSE) could substitute in the\n        wrong place in an MBCS locale.\n\n        gregexpr() could give incorrect answers in MBCS locales for\n        perl = TRUE or fixed = TRUE (unless useBytes = TRUE).\n\n    o   The legacy quartz() device no longer crashes in locator()\n        if the user attempts to close the window.\n\n    o   &quot;CGGStackRestore: gstack underflow&quot; warning is no longer shown\n        in legacy quartz() device.\n\n    o   formatC() now limits 'digits' to 50 to avoid problems in\n        C-level sprintf in some OSes.\n\n    o   seq.int(x, y, by=z) gave 'x' (and not an error) if\n        0 &gt; (y-x)/z &gt; -1.\n\n    o   promptClass() now lists methods, including those for generics in\n        other attached packages.\n\n    o   Connection-related functions such as readBin() no longer crash\n        when supplied with a non-connection object.\n\n    o   as.character.srcref() didn't handle bad srcref objects cleanly.\n\n    o   predict.nls() no longer requires 'newdata' to contain exactly\n        the variable names needed to fit the model: variables used on\n        the LHS only are no longer required and further variables are\n        allowed.\n\n    o   plot.hclust() had a 'out by one' error, and ignored the last\n        object when computing the window region (and could overrun\n        arrays).\n\n    o   deriv() was creating results with double (and not integer) dims.\n\n    o   The unserialize code (e.g. as called by load()) looked for a\n        function findPackageEnv() to set a saved package environment.\n        This was missing, but is now supplied.\n\n    o   [cr]bind could segfault when creating a list matrix result.\n        (Reported by Martin Morgan.)\n\n    o   besselI(x, nu, exp=TRUE) and besselY(x, nu) could give wrong\n        answers for nu &lt; 0. (Reported by Hiroyuki Kawakatsu.)\n\n    o   [g]sub could confuse a trailing byte '\\' for a backreference\n        in MBCSs where '\\' can occur as a trailing byte (not UTF-8 nor\n        EUC-JP, but SJIS and the CJK character sets used on Windows).\n        (PR#9751)\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

This is a development \nrelease which contains a number of new features. In particular:\n\n  - Object name completion by integration of package 'rcompletion' by \n    Deepayan Sarkar\n  - New recommended package 'codetools' by Luke Tierney\n  - New Rscript front-end, which enables shell-like R scripting\n\nalso, a number of mostly minor bugs have been fixed.

(Consequently, e.g.,\n\tt(.)  for such data frames has NULL column names.)  This\n\tchange leads to memory reductions in several places, but can\n\tbreak code which assumes character dimnames for data frames\n\tderived from matrices.\n\n\tNo existing R object is regarded as having 'automatic' row\n\tnames, and it may be beneficial to recreate such objects via\n\tread.table() or data.frame().\n\n    o\tUsing $ on an atomic vector now raises a warning, as does use\n\ton an S4 class for which a method has not been defined.\n\n    o\tThe Unix-alike readline terminal interface now does\n\tcommand-completion for R objects, incorporating the\n\tfunctionality formerly in package 'rcompletion' by Deepayan\n\tSarkar.  This can be disabled by setting the environment\n\tvariable R_COMPLETION=FALSE when starting R (e.g. in\n\t~/.Renviron).  (Note that when this is enabled, filename\n\tcompletion no longer works for file paths containing R\n\toperators such as '+' and '-'.)\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tabbreviate() no longer has an 8191 byte limit on the size of\n\tstrings it can handle.\n\n    o\tabs(x) now returns integer for integer or logical arguments.\n\n    o\tapropos() has a new argument 'ignore.case' which defaults to\n\tTRUE, potentially matching more than previously, thanks to a\n\tsuggestion by Seth Falcon.\n\n    o\targs(), str() and print() now give the argument lists of primitive\n\tfunctions.\n\n    o\tas.matrix() gains the '...' argument that several packages have\n\tassumed it always had (and S-PLUS has).\n\n    o\tManipulation of integers as roman numerals via as.roman() in\n\tpackage utils.\n\n    o\tattr() no longer treats name = NA_character_ as meaning\n\tname = &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o\tbinom.test() now allows a 'fuzz' for calculated integer values\n\tin its x and n arguments.\n\n    o\tboxplot(*, notch = TRUE) now warns when notches are outside\n\thinges; related to PR#7690.\n\n    o\tNew function callCC() providing a downward-only version of\n\tScheme's call with current continuation.\n\n    o\tcapabilities() now has a &quot;profmem&quot; entry indicating whether\n\tR has been compiled with memory profiling.\n\n    o\tcolnames&lt;-() and rownames&lt;-() now handle data frames explicitly,\n\tso calling colnames&lt;- on a data frame no longer alters the\n\trepresentation of the row names.\n\n    o\tcommandArgs() has a new 'trailingOnly' argument to be used in\n\tconjunction with --args.\n\n    o\tcontour() now passes graphical parameters in '...' to axis()\n\tand box().\n\n    o\tNew data set 'crimtab' on Student(1908)'s 3000 criminals.\n\n    o\tcut.default() has a new argument 'ordered_result'.\n\n    o\t.deparseOpts() has two new options: &quot;keepNA&quot; to ensure that\n\tdifferent types (logical, integer, double, character and\n\tcomplex) of NAs are distinguished, and &quot;S_compatible&quot; to\n\tsuppress the use of R-specific features such as 123L and to\n\tdeparse integer values of a double vector with a trailing\n\tdecimal point.\n\n\tThe 'keepInteger' option now uses the suffix 'L' rather than\n\tas.integer() where possible (unless all entries are NA or\n\t&quot;S_compatible&quot; is also set).\n\n\tOther deparse options can now be added to &quot;all&quot; (which has not\n\tfor some time actually switched on all options).\n\n\tInteger sequences m:n are now deparsed in that form.\n\n    o\tdeparse() and dput() now include &quot;keepInteger&quot; and &quot;keepNA&quot; in\n\ttheir defaults for the 'control' argument.\n\n    o   detach() now takes another argument, unload, which indicates\n        whether or not to unload the package and then only cleans\n        up the S4 methods if the package successfully unloads.\n\n    o\tThere are new constants NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_complex_ and\n\tNA_character_ to denote NAs of those types, and they will be\n\tused in deparsing in place of as.integer(NA) etc unless\n\t.deparseOpts() includes &quot;S_compatible&quot;.\n\n    o\tdev.print() now recognizes 'screen devices' as all those with\n\tan enabled display list, rather than a hard-coded set.\n\n    o\tObjects of class &quot;difftime&quot; are now handled more flexibly. The\n\tunits of such objects can now be accessed via a units()\n\tfunction, which also has a replacement form, and there are\n\tconversion methods to and from numeric, which also allow the\n\tspecification of units.\t Objects of this class can also be\n\tstored in data frames now.  A format() method has been added,\n\tand the print method was revised.\n\n    o\tNew function environmentName() to give the print name of\n\tenvironments such as &quot;namespace:base&quot;.\n\tThis is now used by str().\n\n    o\tNew function env.profile() provides R level access to summary\n\tstatistics on environments.  In a related patch, new.env()\n\tnow allows the user to specify an initial size for a hashed\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tfile() can read the X11 clipboard selection as &quot;X11_clipboard&quot;\n\ton suitable X11-using systems.\n\n    o\tfile(&quot;stdin&quot;) is now recognized, and refers to the process's\n\t'stdin' file stream whereas stdin() refers to the console.\n\tThese may differ, for example for a GUI console, an embedded\n\tapplication of R or if --file= has been used.\n\n    o\tfile_test() is now also available in package utils.\n\t(It is now private in package tools.)\n\n    o\tfile.show() gains an 'encoding' argument.\n\n    o\tNew functions formatUL() and formatOL() in package utils for\n\tformatting unordered (itemize) and ordered (enumerate) lists.\n\n    o\tThe statistics reported when gcinfo(TRUE) are now of the amounts\n\tused (in Mb) and not of the amounts free (which are not really\n\trelevant when there are no hard limits, only gc trigger points).\n\n    o\tNew function get_all_vars() to retrieve all the\n\t(untransformed) variables that the default method of\n\tmodel.frame() would use to create the model frame.\n\n    o\tinteraction() has a new argument 'lex.order'.\n\n    o   initialize() (in methods) now tries to be smarter about\n        updating the new instance in place, thereby reducing\n        copying.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages(dependencies = NA) is a new default, which is\n\tto install essential dependencies when installing from\n\trepositories to a single library.  As a result of this change,\n\tupdate.packages() will install any new dependencies of the\n\tpackages it is updating (alongside the package in the same\n\tlibrary tree).\n\n\tIf 'lib' is not specified or is specified of length one and\n\tthe chosen location is not a writable directory,\n\tinstall.packages() offers to create a personal library\n\tdirectory for you if one does not already exist, and to\n\tinstall there.\n\n    o\tis.atomic, is.call, is.character, is.complex, is.double (== is.real),\n\tis.environment, is.expression, is.function, is.integer,\n\tis.list, is.logical, is.null, is.object, is.pairlist,\n\tis.recursive, is.single and is.symbol (== is.name) are no\n\tlonger internally S3 generic, nor can S4 methods be written\n\tfor them.\n\n\tThe &quot;factor&quot; methods of is.integer and is.numeric have been\n\treplaced by internal code.\n\n    o\tAdded is.raw() for completeness.\n\n    o\tl10n_info() also reports if the current locale is Latin-1.\n\n    o\tlevels&lt;-(), names() and names&lt;-() now dispatch internally for\n\tefficiency and so no longer have S3 default methods.\n\n    o\t.libPaths() now does both tilde and glob expansion.\n\n    o\tFunctions lm(), glm() loess(), xtabs() and the default method\n\tof model.frame() coerce their 'formula'\targument (if supplied)\n\tto a formula.\n\n    o\tmax(), min() and range() now work with character vectors.\n\n    o\tmessage() has a new argument 'appendLF' to handle messages\n\twith and without newlines.  There is a new message class\n\tpackageStartupMessage() that can be suppressed separately.\n\n    o\tA new function, method.skeleton() writes a skeleton version of\n        a call to setMethod() to a file, with correct arguments and\n        format, given the name of the function and the method signature.\n\n    o\tmode&lt;- and storage.mode&lt;- do slightly less copying.\n\n    o\tnls.control(* , printEval = FALSE, warnOnly = FALSE) are two new\n\toptions to help better analyze (non-)convergence of nls(),\n\tthanks to Kate Mullen.\n\n\tnls() and summary(nls()) now contain more information and also\n\tprint information about convergence.\n\n    o\toptions(device = ) now accepts a function object as well as\n\tthe name of a function.\n\n    o\tpdf() supports new values for 'paper' of &quot;US&quot; (same as\n\t&quot;letter&quot;), &quot;a4r&quot; and &quot;USr&quot; (the latter two meaning rotated to\n\tlandscape).  postscript() also accepts paper = &quot;US&quot;.\n\n    o\tpersp() now respects the graphical pars 'cex.axis', 'cex.lab',\n\t'font.axis' and 'font.lab'.\n\n    o\tNew faster internal functions pmax.int() and pmin.int() for\n\tinputs which are atomic vectors without classes (called by\n\tpmax/pmin where applicable).\n\n\tpmin/pmax are now more likely to work with classed objects:\n\tthey work with POSIXlt datetimes, for example.\n\n    o\tpostscript() now by default writes grey colors (including black\n\tand white) via 'setgray', which gives more widely acceptable\n\toutput.\t There are options to write pure RGB, CMYK or gray via\n\tthe new argument 'colormodel'.\n\n    o\trbind.data.frame() now ignores all zero-row inputs, as well as\n\tzero-column inputs (which it used to do, undocumented).\t This\n\tis because read.table() can create zero-row data frames with\n\tNULL columns, and those cannot be extended.\n\n    o\treadChar() and writeChar() can now work with a raw vector.\n\n    o\tread.table(), write.table() and allies have been moved to package\n\tutils.\n\n    o\trgb() now accepts the red, green and blue components in a\n\tsingle matrix or data frame.\n\n    o\tNew utility function RShowDoc() in package 'utils' to find and\n\tdisplay manuals and other documentation files.\n\n    o\tNew .row_names_info() utility function finds the number of rows\n\tefficiently for data frames; consequently, dim.data.frame()\n\thas become very fast for large data frames with 'automatic'\n\trow names.\n\n    o\tRSiteSearch() now also allows to search postings of the 'R-devel'\n\tmailing list.\n\n    o\tscreeplot() is now (S3) generic with a default method, thanks\n\tto a patch from Gavin Simpson.\n\n    o\tExperimental 'verbose' argument for selectMethod().  Might be\n\treplaced later by a better interface for method selection\n\tinspection.\n\n    o\tAdded links to source files to the parsing routines, so that\n\tsource() can now echo the original source and comments (rather\n\tthan deparsing).  This affects example() and Sweave() as well.\n\n    o\tstack() and unstack() have been moved to package utils.\n\n    o\tstrptime() now sets the &quot;tzone&quot; attribute on the result if\n\ttz != &quot;&quot;.\n\n    o\tstr.default() typically prints fewer entries of logical vectors.\n\n    o\tThe RweaveLatex driver for Sweave() now supports two new\n\toptions: expand=FALSE, to show chunk references in the output,\n\tand concordance=TRUE, to output the concordance between input\n\tand output lines.\n\n    o\tsystem() now takes the same set of arguments on all platforms,\n\twith those which are not applicable being ignored with a\n\twarning.  Unix-alikes gain 'input' and 'wait', and Windows\n\tgains 'ignore.stderr'.\n\n    o\tsystem.time() and proc.time() now return an object of class\n\t&quot;proc_time&quot; with a print() method that returns a POSIX-like\n\tformat with names.\n\n    o\tSys.getenv() has a new argument 'unset' to allow unset and set\n\tto &quot;&quot; to be distinguished (if the OS does).  The results of\n\tSys.getenv() are now sorted (by name).\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.glob(), a wrapper for the POSIX.2 function\n\tglob(3) to do wildcard expansion (on systems which have it,\n\tplus an emulation on Windows).\n\n    o\tSys.setenv() is a new (and preferred) synonym for Sys.putenv().\n\tThe internal C code uses the POSIX-preferred 'setenv' rather\n\tthan 'putenv' where the former is available.\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.unsetenv() to remove environment variables\n\t(on systems where unsetenv is implemented or putenv can remove\n\tvariables, such as on Windows).\n\n    o\ttext(), mtext(), strheight(), strwidth(), legend(), axis(),\n\ttitle(), pie(), grid.text() and textGrob() all attempt to\n\tcoerce non-language annotation objects (in the sense of is.object)\n\tto character vectors.  This is principally intended to cover\n\tfactors and POSIXt and Date objects, and is done via the\n\tnew utility function as.graphicsAnnot() in package grDevices.\n\n    o\ttcltk:tk_select.list() now chooses the width to fit the widest item.\n\n    o\t{re,un}tracemem() are now primitives for efficiency and so\n\tmigrate from 'utils' to 'base'.\n\n    o\tunion(), interect(), setdiff() and setequal() now coerce their\n\targuments to be vectors (and they were documented only to\n\tapply to vectors).\n\n    o\tuniroot() now works if the zero occurs at one of the ends of\n\tthe interval (suggestion of Tamas Papp).\n\n    o\tThere is a new function View() for viewing matrix-like\n\tobjects in a spreadsheet, which can be left up whilst R is\n\trunning.\n\n    o\tNew function withVisible() allows R level access to the\n\tvisibility flag.\n\n    o\tzip.file.extract() has been moved to package utils.\n\n\n    o\tA few more cases of subassignment work, e.g. &lt;raw&gt;[] &lt;- &lt;list&gt;\n\tand &lt;vector&gt;[] &lt;- &lt;expression&gt;, with suitable coercion of the LHS.\n\n    o\tThere is a warning if \\ is used unnecessarily in a string when\n\tbeing parsed, e.g. &quot;\\.&quot; where probably &quot;\\\\.&quot; was intended.\n\t(&quot;\\.&quot; is valid, but the same as &quot;.&quot;.)  Thanks to Bill Dunlap\n\tfor the suggestion.\n\n    o\tIntroduced the suffix L for integer literals to create\n\tinteger rather than numeric values, e.g. 100L, 0x10L, 1e2L.\n\n    o\tSet the parser to give verbose error messages in case of\n\tsyntax errors.\n\n    o\tThe class &quot;LinearMethodsList&quot; has been extended and will be\n\tused to create list versions of methods, derived from the\n\tmethods tables (environments).\tThe older recursive\n\t&quot;MethodsList&quot; class will be deprecated (by the release of\n\t2.5.0 if possible).\n\n    o\tThere are more flexible ways to specify the default library\n\tsearch path.  In addition to R_LIBS and .Library, there are\n\t.Library.site (defaults to R_HOME/site-library) and\n\tR_LIBS_USER (defaults to a platform- and version-specific\n\tdirectory in ~/R).  See ?.libPaths for details.\n\n    o\tLAPACK has been updated to version 3.1.0.  This should cause\n\tonly small changes to the output, but do remember that the sign\n\tof eigenvectors (and principal components) is indeterminate.\n\n    o\tPCRE has been updated to version 7.0.\n\n    o\tSeveral functions handle row names more efficiently:\n\n\t- read.table() and read.DIF() make use of integer row names\n\t  where appropriate, and avoid at least one copy in assigning\n\t  them.\n\n\t- data.frame() and the standard as.data.frame() methods avoid\n\t  generating long dummy row names and then discarding them.\n\n\t- expand.grid() and merge() generate compact 'automatic' row\n\t  names.\n\n\t- data.matrix() and as.matrix.data.frame() have a new argument\n\t  'rownames.force' that by default drops 'automatic' row names.\n\n    o\t&lt;data frame&gt;[i, j] is substantially more memory-efficient when\n\tonly a small part of the data frame is selected, especially\n\twhen (part of) a single column is selected.\n\n    o\tCommand-line R (and Rterm.exe under Windows) accepts the options\n\t'-f filename', '--file=filename' and '-e expression' to follow\n\tother script interpreters.  These imply --no-save unless\n\t--save is specified.\n\n    o\tInvalid bytes in character strings in an MBCS now deparse/print\n\tin the form &quot;\\xc1&quot; rather than &quot;&lt;c1&gt;&quot;, which means they can be\n\tparsed/scanned.\n\n    o\tPrinting functions (without source attributes) and expressions\n\tnow preserves integers (using the L suffix) and NAs (using\n\tNA_real_ etc where necessary).\n\n    o\tThe 'internal' objects .helpForCall, .tryHelp and topicName are\n\tno longer exported from 'utils'.\n\n    o\tThe internal regex code has been upgraded to glibc 2.5 (from 2.3.6).\n\n    o\tText help now attempts to display files which have an \\encoding\n\tsection in the specified encoding via file.show().\n\n    o\tR now attempts to keep track of character strings which are\n\tknown to be in Latin-1 or UTF-8 and print or plot them\n\tappropriately in other locales.\t This is primarily intended\n\tto make it possible to use data in Western European languages\n\tin both Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales.  Currently scan(),\n\tread.table(), readLines(), parse() and source() allow\n\tencodings to be declared, and console input in suitable\n\tlocales is also recognized.\n\n\tNew function Encoding() can read or set the declared encodings\n\tfor a character vector.\n\n    o\tThere have been numerous performance improvements to the data\n\teditor on both Windows and X11.\t In particular, resizing the\n\twindow works much better on X11.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tsymbol.C() and symbol.For() are defunct, and have been replaced\n\tby wrappers that give a warning.\n\n    o\tCalling a builtin function with an empty argument is now always\n\tan error.\n\n    o\tThe autoloading of ts() is defunct.\n\n    o\tThe undocumented reserved word GLOBAL.ENV has been removed.\n\t(It was yet another way to get the value of the symbol\n\t.GlobalEnv.)\n\n    o\tThe deprecated behaviour of structure() in adding a class when\n\tspecifying with &quot;tsp&quot; or &quot;levels&quot; attributes is now defunct.\n\n    o\tunix() is now finally defunct, having been deprecated for\n\tat least seven years.\n\n    o\tSys.putenv() is now deprecated in favour of Sys.setenv(),\n\tfollowing the POSIX recommendation.\n\n    o\tBuilding R with --without-iconv is deprecated.\n\n    o\tUsing $ on an atomic vector is deprecated (it was previously\n\tvalid and documented to return NULL).\n\n    o\tThe use of storage.mode&lt;- for other than standard types (and\n        in particular for value &quot;single&quot;) is deprecated: use mode&lt;-\n\tinstead.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o\tA suitable iconv (e.g. from glibc or GNU libiconv) is\n\trequired.  For 2.5.x only you can build R without it by\n\tconfiguring using --without-iconv.\n\n    o\tThere is support again for building on AIX (tested on 5.2 and 5.3)\n\tthanks to Ei-ji Nakama.\n\n    o\tAutoconf 2.60 or later is used to create 'configure'.  This\n\tmakes a number of small changes, and incorporates the changes\n\tto the detection of a C99-compliant C compiler backported for\n\t2.4.1.\n\n    o\tDetection of a Java development environment was added such that\n\tpackages don't need to provide their own Java detection. Newly\n\tadded make variables are JAVAC, JAVAH, JAR and JAVA_CPPFLAGS.\n\n\tR CMD javareconf was updated to look for the corresponding\n\tJava tools as well.\n\n\tIn addition, Java detection honors user-supplied environment\n\tvariables JAVA_CPPFLAGS, JAVA_LIBS and JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\n    o\tAdded workaround for reported non-POSIX sh on OSF1.  (PR#9375)\n\n    o\t'make install-strip' now works, stripping the executables and\n\talso the shared libraries and modules on platforms where\n\t'libtool' knows how to do so.\n\n    o\tBuilding R as a shared library and standalone nmath now\n\tinstalls pkg-config files 'libR.pc' and 'libRmath.pc' respectively.\n\n    o\tAdded test for insufficiently complete implementation of sigaction.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tFunctions str2type, type2char and type2str are now available in\n\tRinternals.h.\n\n    o\tAdded support for Objective C in R and packages (if available).\n\n    o\tR_ParseVector() has a new 4th argument 'SEXP srcfile' allowing\n\tsource references to be attached to the returned expression list.\n\n    o\tAdded ptr_R_WriteConsoleEx callback which allows consoles to\n\tdistinguish between regular output and errors/warnings.\n\tTo ensure backward compatibility it is only used if\n\tptr_R_WriteConsole is set to NULL.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tAdditional Sweave() internal functions are exported to help\n\twriting new drivers, and RweaveLatexRuncode() is now created\n\tusing a helper function (all from a patch submitted by Seth\n\tFalcon).\n\n    o\tThe following additional flags are accessible from R CMD config:\n\tOBJC, OBJCFLAGS, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVAH, JAVA_HOME, JAVA_LIBS\n\tand JAVA_CPPFLAGS.\n\n    o\tR CMD build now takes the package name from the DESCRIPTION\n\tfile and not from the directory.  (PR#9266)\n\n    o\tcheckS3methods() (and hence R CMD check) now checks agreement\n\twith primitive internal generics, and checks for additional\n\targuments in methods where the generic does not have a '...'\n\targument.\n\n\tcodoc() now knows the argument lists of primitive functions.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL and R CMD REMOVE now use as the default library\n\t(if -l is not specified) the first library that would be used\n\tif R were run in the current environment (and they run R to\n\tfind it).\n\n    o\tThere is a new front-end Rscript which can be used for #!\n\tscripts and similar tasks.  See help(&quot;Rscript&quot;) and 'An\n\tIntroduction to R' for further details.\n\n    o\tR CMD BATCH (not Windows) no longer prepends\n\t'invisible(options(echo = TRUE))' to the input script.  This\n\twas the default unless --slave is specified and the latter is\n\tno longer overridden.\n\n\tOn all OSes it makes use of the -f argument to R, so\n\tfile(&quot;stdin&quot;) can be used from BATCH scripts.\n\n\tOn all OSes it reports proc.time() at the end of the script\n\tunless q() is called with options to inhibit this.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL now prepends the installation directory (if\n\tspecified) to the library search path.\n\n    o\tPackage installation now re-encodes R files and the NAMESPACE\n\tfile if the DESCRIPTION file specifies an encoding, and sets\n\tthe encoding used for reading files in preparing for\n\tLazyData.  This will help if a package needs to be used in\n\t(say) both latin1 and UTF-8 locales on different systems.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now reports on non-ASCII strings in datasets.\n\t(These are a portability issue, which can be alleviated by\n\tmarking their encoding: see 'Writing R Extensions'.)\n\n    o\tRdiff now converts CRLF endings in the target file, and\n\tconverts UTF-8 single quotes in either to ASCII quotes.\n\n    o\tNew recommended package 'codetools' by Luke Tierney provides\n\tcode-analysis tools.  This can optionally be used by 'R CMD\n\tcheck' to detect problems, especially symbols which are not\n\tvisible.\n\n    o\tR CMD config now knows about LIBnn .\n\n    o\tNew recommended package 'rcompgen' by Deepayan Sarkar\n\tprovides support for command-line completion under the Unix\n\tterminal interface (provided readline is enabled) and the\n\tWindows Rgui and Rterm front ends.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tgc() can now report quantities of 'Vcells' in excess of 16Gb on\n\t64-bit systems (rather than reporting NA).\n\n    o\tAssigning class &quot;factor&quot; to an object now requires it has\n\tinteger (and not say double) codes.\n\n    o\tstructure() ensures that objects with added class &quot;factor&quot; have\n\tinteger codes.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;formula&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; attributes of datasets 'ChickWeight',\n\t'CO2', 'DNase', 'Indometh', 'Loblolly', 'Orange' and 'Theoph'\n\tnow have an empty environment and not the environment used to\n\tdump the datasets in the package.\n\n    o\tDataset 'Seatbelts' now correctly has class c(&quot;mts&quot;, &quot;ts&quot;).\n\n    o\tstr() now labels classes on data frames more coherently.\n\n    o\tSeveral 'special' primitives and .Internals could return\n\tinvisibly if the evaluation of an argument led to the\n\tvisibility flag being turned off.  These included\n\tas.character(), as.vector(), call(), dim(), dimnames(),\n\tlapply(), rep(), seq() and seq_along().  Others (e.g. dput()\n\tand print.default()) could return visibly when this was not\n\tintended.\n\n    o\tSeveral primitives such as dim() were not checking the number\n\tof arguments supplied before method dispatch.\n\n    o\tTracing of primitive functions has been corrected.  It should\n\tnow be the case that tracing either works or is not allowed\n\tfor all primitive functions. (Problems remain if you make a\n\tprimitive into a generic when it is being traced.  To be fixed\n\tlater.)\n\n    o\tmax.col() now omits infinite values in determining the\n\trelative tolerance.\n\n    o\tR CMD Sweave and R CMD Stangle now respond to --help and --version\n\tlike other utilities.\n\n    o\t.libPaths() adds only existing directories (as it was\n\tdocumented to, but could add non-directories).\n\n    o\tsetIs() and setClassUnion() failed to find some existing\n\tsubclasses and produced spurious warnings, now fixed.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() ignored 'row.names' for 0-column data frames, and\n\tno longer treats an explicit row.names=NULL differently from\n\tthe default value.\n\n    o\tidentical() looked at the internal structure of the\n\t'row.names' attribute, and not the value visible at R level.\n\n    o\tabline(reg) now also correctly works with intercept-only lm\n\tmodels, and abline() warns more when it's called illogically.\n\n    o\twarning() was truncating messages at\n\tgetOption(&quot;warning.length&quot;) - 1 (not as documented), with no\n\tindication.  It now appends '[... truncated]'.\n\n    o\tStangle/Sweave were throwing spurious warnings if options\n\t'result' or 'strip.white' were unset.\n\n    o\tall.equal() was ignoring 'check.attributes' for list and\n\texpression targets, and checking only attributes on raw vectors.\n\tLogical vectors were being compared as if they were numeric,\n\t(with a mean difference being quoted).\n\n    o\tCalculating the number of significant digits in a number was\n\titself subject to rounding errors for digits &gt;= 16.  The\n\tcalculation has been changed to err on the side of slightly\n\ttoo few significant digits (but still at least 15) rather than\n\tfar too many.  (An example is print(1.001, digits=16).)\n\n    o\tunlink() on Unix-alikes failed for paths containing spaces.\n\n    o\tsubstr() and friends treated NA 'start' or 'stop' incorrectly.\n\n    o\tmerge(x, y, all.y = TRUE) would sometimes incorrectly return\n\tlogical columns for columns only in y when there were no\n\tcommon rows.\n\n    o\tread.table(fn, col.names=) on an empty file returned NULL\n\tcolumns, rather than logical(0) columns (which is what results\n\tfrom reading a file with just a header).\n\n    o\tgrid.[xy]axis(label=logical(0)) failed.\n\n    o\texpression() was unnecessarily duplicating arguments.\n\n    o\tas.expression(&lt;list&gt;) returned a single-element expression\n\tvector, which was not compatible with S: it now copies lists\n\telement-by-element.\n\n    o\tsupsmu(periodic = TRUE) could segfault.  (PR#9502, detection\n\tand patch by Bill Dunlap.)\n\n    o\tpmax/pmin called with only logical arguments did not coerce to\n\tnumeric, although they were documented to do so (as max/min\n\tdo).\n\n    o\tmethods() did not know that cbind() and rbind() are internally\n\tgeneric.\n\n    o\tdim(x) &lt;- NULL removed the names of x, but this was always\n\tundocumented.  It is not clear that it is desirable but it is\n\tS-compatible and relied on, so is now documented.\n\n    o\twhich(x, arr.ind = TRUE) did not return a matrix (as\n\tdocumented) if 'x' was an array of length 0.\n\n    o\tC-level duplicate() truncated CHARSXPs with embedded nuls.\n\n    o\tPartial matching of attributes was not working as documented\n\tin some cases if there were more than two partial matches or\n\tif &quot;names&quot; was involved.\n\n    o\tdata(package=character(0)) was not looking in ./data as\n\tdocumented.\n\n    o\tsummary.mlm() failed if some response names were &quot;&quot; (as can\n\teasily happen if cbind() is used).\n\n    o\tThe postscript() and pdf() drivers shared an encoding list\n\tbut used slightly different formats.  This caused problems if\n\tboth were used with the same non-default encoding in the same\n\tsession.  (PR#9517)\n\n    o\tThe data editor was not allowing Inf, NA and NaN to be entered\n\tin numerical columns.  It was intended to differentiate\n\tbetween empty cells and NAs, but did not do so: it now does\n\tso for strings.\n\n    o\tsupsmu() could segfault if all cases had non-finite values.\n\t(PR#9519)\n\n    o\tplnorm(x, lower.tail=FALSE) was returning the wrong tail for\n\tx &lt;= 0.  (PR#9520)\n\n    o\twhich.min() would not report a minimum of +Inf, and\n\tanalogously for which.max().  (PR#9522)\n\n    o\t'R CMD check' could fail with an unhelpful error when checking\n\tRd files for errors if there was only one file and that had a\n\tserious error.  (PR#9459)\n\n    o\ttry() has been reimplemented using tryCatch() to solve two\n\tproblems with the original implementation: (i) try() would run\n\tnon-NULL options(&quot;error&quot;) expressions for errors within a try, and\n\t(ii) try() would catch user interrupts.\n\n    o\tstr(obj) could fail when obj contained a dendrogram.\n\n    o\tUsing &lt;data frame&gt;[, &lt;last column&gt;] &lt;- NULL failed (PR#9565)\n\n    o\tchoose(n, k) could return non-integer values for integer n and\n\tsmall k on some platforms.\n\n    o\tnclass.scott(x) and nclass.FD(x) no longer return NaN when var(x)\n\tor IQR(x) (respectively) is zero.\n\n\thist() now allows breaks = 1 (which the above patch will\n\treturn), but not breaks = Inf (which gave an obscure error).\n\n    o\tstrptime(&quot;%j&quot;) now also works for the first days of Feb-Dec.\n\t(PR#9577)\n\n    o\twrite.table() now recovers better if 'file' is an unopened\n\tconnection.  (It used to open it for both the column names and\n\tthe data.)\n\n    o\tFixed bug in mosaicplot(sort=) introduced by undocumented\n\tchange in R 2.4.1 (changeset r39655).\n\n    o\tcontr.treatment(n=0) failed with a spurious error message.\n\t(It remains an error.)\n\n    o\tas.numeric() was incorrectly documented: it is identical to\n\tas.double.\n\n    o\tjitter(rep(-1, 3)) gave NaNs. (PR#9580)\n\n    o\tmax.col() was not random for a row of zeroes. (PR#9542)\n\n    o\tansari.test(conf.int=TRUE, exact=FALSE) failed.\n\n    o\ttrace() now works on S3 registered methods, by modifying the\n\tversion in the S3 methods table.\n\n    o\trep(length=1, each=0) segfaulted.\n\n    o\tpostscript() could overflow a buffer if used with a long\n\t'command' argument.\n\n    o\tThe internal computations to copy complete attribute lists did\n\tnot copy the flag marking S4 objects, so the copies no longer\n\tbehaved like S4 objects.\n\n    o\tThe C code of nlminb() was altering a variable without\n\tduplicating it.  (This did not affect nlminb() but would have\n\tif the code was called from a different wrapper.)\n\n    o\tsmooth(kind = &quot;3RS3R&quot;) (the current default) used .C(DUP =\n\tFALSE) but altered its input argument.  (This was masked by\n\tduplication in as.double.)\n\n    o\tThe signature for the predefined S4 method for as.character()\n\twas missing '...' .\n\n    o\treadBin(&lt;raw vector&gt;) could read beyond the end of the vector\n\twhen size-changing was involved.\n\n    o\tThe C entry point PrintValue (designed to emulate auto-printing)\n\twould not find show() for use on S4 objects, and did not have\n\tthe same search path (for show(), print() and print() methods)\n\tas auto-printing.  Also, auto-printing and print() of S4\n\tobjects would fail to find 'show' if the methods namespace was\n\tloaded but the package was not attached (or otherwise not in\n\tthe search path).\n\n    o\tprint() (and auto-printing) now recognize S4 objects even when\n\t'methods' is not loaded, and print a short summary rather than\n\tdump the internal structure.\n\n    o\tSweave and Stangle had problems due to partial matching of code\n\tchunk names when run with split=TRUE.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() on a source package now ensures that\n\tR CMD INSTALL sees the same library search path as\n\tinstall.packages() did when computing dependencies.\n\n    o\tdensity() now ensures its 'y' values are non-negative. (PR#8876)\n\n    o\tis.finite() and is.infinite() (and many other primitives)\n\tare not internally generic and so do not support S4 methods,\n\twhich can no longer be set. (PR#7951)\n\n    o\tnls(algorithm = &quot;port&quot;) now accepts a list 'start' argument,\n\tas for the other methods (and as documented).\n\n    o\tStandard errors from the &quot;ar&quot; method of predict() could be\n\twrong for the last p predictions for models near\n\tnon-stationarity.

However, on Windows the 'Last\n        Changed Date' will be in the local timezone, and not in GMT as\n        previously.\n\n    o   configure uses code borrowed from autoconf 2.60 to try harder to\n        ensure that a C99-compliant compiler is used.  (It does so by\n        appending to CC.)  This avoids problems with systems such as FC5\n        which override CFLAGS and thereby lose flags such as -std=gnu99.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   rainbow(), heat.colors(), terrain.colors(), topo.colors() and\n        cm.colors() all gain an 'alpha' argument to be passed to hsv().\n\n    o   dput() will give an incorrect representation of the row names\n        of a data frame with integer row names.  This is now corrected\n        when the object is recreated.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o   Using STRICT_R_HEADERS applies to more reported clashes with\n        Windows headers, including Calloc and Realloc.  These and\n        Free need to be prefixed by R_ when STRICT_R_HEADERS is defined.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   The previously undocumented behaviour of structure() in adding a\n        class when specifying &quot;tsp&quot; or &quot;levels&quot; attributes is now\n        deprecated (with a warning).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Fixed warning() to use .dfltWarn intead of .dfltStop for default\n        handling (PR#9274).\n\n    o   R would slow down when the product of the length of a vector and\n        the length of a character vector used to subset it exceeded 2^31.\n        (PR#9280)\n\n    o   merge() now allows zero-row data frames.\n\n    o   add1.lm() had been broken by other changes for weighted fits.\n\n    o   axis.POSIXct() would sometimes give the wrong labels.\n\n    o   Help for a method call would fail. (PR#9291)\n\n    o   gzfile() returned an object of class &quot;file&quot; not &quot;gzfile&quot;. (PR#9271)\n\n    o   load()ing from a connection had a logic bug in when it closed\n        the connection. (PR#9271)\n\n    o   The lowess() algorithm is unstable if the MAD of the residuals\n        becomes (effectively) zero: R now terminates the iterations at\n        that point.  (This may result in quite different answers.)\n\n        The 'delta' argument was incorrectly documented.  (PR#9264)\n\n    o   abbreviate() would only work for strings of up to 8191 bytes,\n        but this was not checked.  Now longer strings are errors.\n\n    o   Drawing X11 rotated text was buggy for VERY small (negative)\n        angle of rotation.  Reported by Ben Bolker. (PR#9301)\n\n    o   The X11 data editor would crash in an MBCS locale if R was\n        compiled with FC's CFLAGS that add buffer overflow and\n        stack-smashing detection.\n\n    o   rect() was not accepting border=NA in some cases involving\n        cross-hatching.\n\n    o   Fixes to S4 group generics to ensure that the correct number of\n        active arguments are in the signature of the group and all\n        members.  Also a fix to keep the 'groupMembers' slot up to date.\n\n    o   S4 group generic &quot;Logic&quot; (with '&amp;', '|', but not '!') has been\n        created, following the green book (apart from '!').\n\n    o   removeClass() now takes care to remove any subclass references\n        to the deleted class.\n\n    o   mle() (in stats4) might not have worked as intended when the\n        order of parameters in 'start' differed from that in the\n        log-likelihood.  (PR#9313)\n\n    o   dotchart() now properly restores par() settings after itself.\n\n    o   system() on Mac OS X was blocking arbitrary signals during the\n        call although only SIGPROF was meant to be blocked.\n\n    o   methods cached via callNextMethod() and (sometimes) as() were\n        being cached as directly specified although in fact they were\n        inherited.  Caused problems in later search for inherited methods.\n\n    o   str() works properly for method definitions and other S4-classed\n        function objects.\n\n    o   JAVA_LIBS are now set correctly on MacOS X.\n\n    o   Fix null-termination issue suspected of causing crash with Fedora\n        Extra RPMS (PR#9339, Justin Harrington, analysis and fix from Bill\n        Dunlap).\n\n    o   Namespaces restored via a saved session silently failed to cache\n        their methods because the methods package was not yet\n        attached.  Fixed by attaching methods before restoring data.\n\n    o   rbind()ing a list to a data frame generated invalid row names,\n        which were an error in 2.4.0. (PR#9346)\n\n    o   boxplot.stats(x) now returns the correct minimum instead of an\n        error for x &lt;- c(1,Inf,Inf,Inf), and hence boxplot(x) &quot;works&quot;.\n\n    o   promptClass() now uses \\linkS4class{&lt;ClassName&gt;} instead of\n        of \\link{&lt;ClassName&gt;-class}.\n\n    o   gc() no longer reports nonsense values for the number of used\n        Vcells if the true value exceeds 2^31 (and hence over 16Gb of\n        heap is in use): it now reports NA. (PR#9345)\n\n    o   rapply() now detects more user errors in supplying arguments.\n(PR#9349)\n\n    o   boxplot() was ignoring argument 'boxfill'. (PR#9352)\n\n    o   plot.lm(which = 6, id.n = 0) did not work. (PR#9333)\n\n    o   .deparseOpts(&quot;delayPromises&quot;) was not matching the C code,\n        returning 64 rather than 32.\n\n    o   bxp() could use partial matching on 'pars' when finding\n        defaults for some of its parameters, e.g. a setting of 'cex.axis'\n        in 'pars' or inline was used to set a default for 'outcex'.\n\n    o   acf() now allows lag.max = 0 except when type=&quot;partial&quot;, and\n        forces the lag 0 autocorrelation to 1. (PR#9360)\n\n    o   hist(*, include.lowest=., right=., plot=FALSE) does not warn\n        anymore, (PR#9356) and more.\n\n    o   Some bugs in caching superclass/subclass relations and in\n        removing those relations on detach and on removeClass() have\n        been fixed.\n\n    o   readBin() could return one too many strings if 'n' was an\n        over-estimate. (PR#9361)\n\n    o   A request for an opaque colour in the pdf() device after a\n        translucent one did not set the transparency back to opaque in\n        2.4.0.\n\n        Semi-transparent background colours were not being plotted on\n        the pdf() device.\n\n    o   plot.lm(which=5) in the case of constant leverage re-ordered\n        the factor levels but not the residuals, so the labelling by\n        factor level was often incorrect.\n\n    o   packBits() was not accepting a logical argument. (PR#9374)\n\n    o   make install was omitting doc/FAQ and doc/RESOURCES.\n\n    o   A two-sample t.test(x, y, var.equal=TRUE) did not allow one of the\n        groups to be of size one.\n\n    o   The &quot;ts&quot; method for print() failed on some corrupted objects\n        of class &quot;ts&quot;, e.g. those without a &quot;tsp&quot; attribute.\n\n    o   structure() reordered the &quot;class&quot; value given if there was a\n        &quot;tsp&quot; value specified.\n\n    o   pairs() now does pass appropriate parts of '...' to the\n        'diag.panel' argument. (PR#9384)\n\n    o   plot.lm() was using an incorrect estimate of dispersion for\n        some GLMs (including family=binomial and family=poisson).\n        (PR#9316)\n\n    o   Subsetting operators were setting R_Visible too early, so\n        assignments in arguments could make the result invisible.\n        (PR#9263)\n\n    o   The tk-GUI was displaying a warning due to an extra comma in\n        the list of manuals (PR#9396)\n\n    o   packageDescription() now gives an explicit error on a corrupt\n        DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o   There was a scoping issue with tcltk callbacks given as\n        unevaluated expressions. This has only been partially fixed, a\n        complete fix probably requires redesign.\n\n    o   trace() had its return value documented incorrectly and was\n        sometimes visible when it should not have been.\n\n    o   pchisq() would sometimes use the wrong tail when calculating\n        non-central probabilities with lower.tail = FALSE. (PR#9406)\n\n    o   rm() could remove the wrong objects when passed an expression.\n        (PR#9399)  Now only names are allowed in the '...' argument,\n        and the incorrect documentation of what happened with\n        character objects is corrected.\n\n    o   url() was not supporting 'encoding' except on file:// URLs.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

The old behaviour\n\t(to save the promise and its evaluation environment) can be\n\tobtained by setting the new argument 'eval.promises' to FALSE.\n\t(Note that this does not apply to promises embedded in\n\tobjects, only to top-level objects.)\n\n    o\tThe functions read.csv(), read.csv2(), read.delim(),\n\tread.delim2() now default their 'comment.char' argument to &quot;&quot;.\n\t(These functions are designed to read files produced by other\n\tsoftware, which might use the # character inside fields, but\n\tare unlikely to use it for comments.)\n\n    o\tThe bindings in the base environment/namespace (currently the\n\tsame thing) are now locked.  This means that the values of\n\tbase functions cannot be changed except via\n\tassignInNamespace() and similar tricks.\n\n    o\t[[ on a factor now returns a one-element factor (and not an\n\tinteger), as.list() on a factor returns a list of one-element\n\tfactors (and not of character vectors), and unlist() on a list\n\tof factors returns a factor (and not an integer vector).\n\tThese changes may affect the results of sapply() and lapply()\n\tapplied to factors.\n\n    o\tmauchly.test() now returns the W statistic (for comparability\n\twith SAS and SPSS), rather than the z (which was accidentally\n\tnot named in the output)\n\n    o\tsort(x, decreasing = FALSE, ...) is now a generic function.\n\tThis means that 'partial' is no longer the second argument,\n\tand calls which used positional matching may be incorrect: we\n\ttry to detect them.\n\n    o\tSee the section on 'Changes to S4 methods': all packages\n\tdepending on 'methods' need to be re-installed.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tagrep(), grep(), strwrap(), strtrim(), substr() and\n\trelated functions now coerce arguments which should be\n\tcharacter via as.character() rather than internally (so method\n\tdispatch takes place, e.g. for factors).\n\n\tchartr(), charfold(), tolower() and toupper() now coerce their\n\tmain argument if necessary to a character vector via\n\tas.character().\n\n\tFunctions which work element-by-element on character vectors\n\tto give a character result now preserve attributes including\n\tnames, dims and dimnames (as suggested by the Blue Book\n\tp. 144).  Such functions include charfold(), chartr(), gsub(),\n\tstrtrim(), sub(), substr(), tolower() and toupper().  (Note\n\tthat coercion of a non-character argument may lose the\n\tattributes.)\n\n\tagrep(value = TRUE) preserves names for compatibility with\n\tgrep().\n\n\tnchar() has always preserved dims/dimnames (undocumented\n\tbefore) and now also preserves names.\n\n\n    o\t.Deprecated and .Defunct take a new parameter, msg, that allows\n\tfor the specification of the message printed and facilitates\n\tdeprecation of calling sequences etc.\n\n    o\t.Fortran() will map 'name' to lower case, and will work with\n\t'name' containing underscores.\n\n    o\tThe default is now .saveRDS(compress = TRUE)\n\n    o\tThe :: operator now also works for packages without name spaces\n\tthat are on the search path.\n\n    o\t[[ on a list does not duplicate the extracted element unless\n\tnecessary.  (It did not duplicate in other cases, e.g. a\n\tpairlist.)\n\n    o\targsAnywhere() works like args() on non-exported functions.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame() gains a '...' argument.\n\n    o\tAdded an as.data.frame() method for class &quot;ftable&quot;.\n\n    o\tas.list(&lt;an expression&gt;) is now handled by internal code and\n\tno longer loses attributes such as names.\n\n\tas.list(&lt;a list&gt;) no longer duplicates (unnecessarily).\n\n    o\tas.POSIX[cl]t can now convert character strings containing\n\tfractional seconds.\n\n    o\tattach() can now attach a copy of an environment.\n\n    o\tavailable.packages() and installed.packages() gain a 'fields'\n\targument thanks to Seth Falcon.\n\n    o\taxis.POSIXct() uses a different algorithm for ranges of 2 to 50\n\tdays that will mark days at midnight in the current timezone\n\t(even if the graph crosses a DST change).\n\n    o\tbody&lt;-() and formals&lt;-() default to envir = environment(fun),\n\tthat is they do not by default change the environment.\n\t(Previously they changed it to parent.frame().)\n\n    o\tNew function combn(x, m, ..) for computing on all combinations of\n\tsize 'm' (for small 'm' !).\n\n    o\tThe cumxxx() functions now handle logical/integer arguments\n\tseparately from numeric ones, and so return an integer result\n\twhere appropriate.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() has a new argument 'stringsAsFactor'.  This and\n\tthe default for read.table(as.is=) are set from the new global\n\toption 'stringsAsFactors' via the utility function\n\tdefault.stringsAsFactors().\n\n    o\tdev.interactive() now has an optional argument 'orNone'.\n\n    o\tdf() now has a noncentrality argument 'ncp', based on a\n\tcontribution by Peter Ruckdeschel.\n\n    o\texample() gains an argument 'ask' which defaults to &quot;TRUE when\n\tsensible&quot;, but the default can be overridden by setting option\n\t'example.ask'.\n\n    o\texpand.grid() now has an argument 'KEEP.OUT.ATTRS' which can\n\tsuppress (the potentially expensive) &quot;out.attrs&quot; attribute. It no\n\tlonger returns an extraneous 'colnames' attribute.\n\n    o\tThe subset and subassign methods for factors now handle factor\n\tmatrices, and dim() can be set on a factor.\n\n    o\tThere is now a format() method for class &quot;ftable&quot;.\n\n    o\thead(x, n) and tail(x, n) now also work for negative arguments,\n\tthanks to Vincent Goulet.\n\n    o\thead.matrix() and tail.matrix() are no longer hidden, to be used\n\tfor building head() and tail() methods for other classes.\n\n    o\tIf help() finds multiple help files for a given topic, a menu\n\tof titles is used to allow interactive choice.\n\n    o\thelp.search() now rebuilds the database if 'package' specifies a\n\tpackage not in the saved database.\n\n    o\thist(*, plot = FALSE) now warns about unused arguments.\n\n    o\thistory() gains a 'pattern' argument as suggested by Romain\n\tFrancois.\n\n    o\tinteger(0) now prints as that rather than &quot;numeric(0)&quot; (it\n\talways deparsed as &quot;integer(0)&quot;).\n\n    o\tinteraction(..., drop=TRUE) now gives the same result as\n\tinteraction(...)[,drop=TRUE] (it used to sometimes give a\n\tdifferent order for the levels).\n\n    o\tlag.plot() produces a conventional plot (not setting mfrow) if\n\tonly one plot is to be produced.\n\n    o\tlapply() does much less copying.  Vector X are handled without\n\tduplication, and other types are coerced via as.list().\t (As a\n\tresult, package 'boot' runs its examples 4% faster.)\n\n\tlapply(&lt;a pairlist&gt;) now coerces to a list (rather than traverse\n\tthe pairlist from the beginning for each item).\n\n    o\tlegend() has new parameters 'box.lwd' and 'box.lty'.\n\n    o\tlines() gains a simple method for isoreg() results.\n\n    o\tload() no longer coerces pairlists to lists (which was\n\tundocumented, but has been happening since 1998).\n\n    o\tmake.link() now returns an object of class &quot;link-glm&quot;.\n\tThe GLM families accept an object of this class for their\n\t'link' argument, which allows user-specified link functions.\n\tAlso, quasi() allows user-specified variance functions.\n\n    o\tmapply() uses names more analogously to lapply(), e.g..\n\n    o\tmatplot() now accepts a 'bg' argument similarly to plot.default() etc.\n\n    o\tmedian() is now generic, and its default method uses mean()\n\trather than sum() and so is more widely applicable (e.g. to dates).\n\n    o\tDummy functions memory.size() and memory.limit() are available\n\ton Unix-alikes, for people who have not noticed that documentation\n\tis Windows-specific.\n\n    o\tmerge() works more efficiently when there are relatively few\n\tmatches between the data frames (for example, for 1-1\n\tmatching).  The order of the result is changed for 'sort = FALSE'.\n\n    o\tmerge() now inserts row names as a character column and not a\n\tfactor: this makes the default sort order more comprehensible.\n\n    o\tRaw, complex and character vectors are now allowed in model\n\tframes (there was a previously undocumented restriction to\n\tlogical, integer and numeric types.).  Character vectors in a\n\tformula passed to model.matrix() are converted to factors and\n\tcoded accordingly.\n\n    o\tmodifyList() utility, typically for housekeeping nested lists.\n\n    o\tx &lt;- 1:20; y &lt;- rnorm(x); nls(y ~ A*exp(-x^2/sig)) no longer\n\treturns an unhelpful error message.  In this and similar cases, it\n\tnow tries a wild guess for starting values.\n\n    o\tOps.difftime() now handles unary minus and plus.\n\n    o\tOps.Date() and Ops.POSIXt() now allow character arguments\n\t(which are coerced to the appropriate class before comparison,\n\tfor Ops.POSIXt() using the current time zone).\n\n    o\tThere is a new option(max.contour.segments = 25000) which can be\n\traised to allow extremely complex contour lines in contour()\n\tand contourLines().  (PR#9205)\n\n    o\toptions(max.print = N) where N defaults to 99999 now cuts printing\n\tof large objects after about N entries.\t print(x, ..., max = N)\n\tdoes the same for the default method and those building on\n\tprint.default().\n\n\toptions(&quot;menu.graphics&quot;) controls if graphical menus should be\n\tused when available.\n\n\toptions(&quot;par.ask.default&quot;) allows the default for par(&quot;ask&quot;)\n\tto be set for a newly-opened device.  (Defaults to FALSE, the\n\tprevious behaviour.)\n\n\tThe way option(&quot;papersize&quot;) is set has been changed.  On\n\tplatforms which support the LC_PAPER locale category, the\n\tsetting is taken first from the R_PAPERSIZE environment\n\tvariable at run time, then from the LC_PAPER category\n\t(&quot;letter&quot; for _US and _CA locales and &quot;a4&quot; otherwise).\tOn\n\tother platforms (including Windows and older Unixen), the\n\tchoice is unchanged.\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() gains arguments 'namespace' and\n\t'code_files'.\n\n    o\tpar(ask=TRUE) now only applies to interactive R sessions.\n\n    o\tparse() now returns up to 'n' expressions, rather than fill\n\tthe expressions vector with NULL.  (This is now compatible\n\twith S.)\n\n    o\tThe 'version' argument for pdf() is now increased\n\tautomatically (with a warning) if features which need a higher\n\tlevel are used.\n\n    o\tpie() now allows expressions for 'labels', and empty slices.\n\n    o\tThere is a new '%.%' operator for mathematical annotations\n\t(plotmath) which draws a centred multiplication dot\n\t(a \\cdot in LaTeX), thanks to Uwe Ligges.\n\n    o\tpredict.lm() gains a 'pred.var' argument.  (Wishlist PR#8877.)\n\n    o\tprint.summary.{aov,glm,lm,nls} and print.{aov,glm} make use of\n\tnaprint() to report when na.action altered the model frame.\n\n    o\tprint.table(T, zero.print=ch) now also replaces 0 by ch when T is\n\tnon-integer with integer entries.\n\n    o\tRecursive rapply() which is similar to lapply but used\n\trecursively and can restrict the classes of elements to which\n\tit is applied.\n\n    o\tr2dtable() has been moved to package 'stats'.\n\n    o\tNew function read.DIF() to read Data Interchange Format files,\n\tand (on Windows) this format from the clipboard.\n\n    o\tNew experimental function readNEWS() to read R's own &quot;NEWS&quot; file\n\tand similarly formatted ones.\n\n    o\treadLines() has a new argument 'warn' to suppress warnings:\n\tthe default behaviour is still to warn.\n\n    o\treg.finalizer() has a new argument 'onexit' to parallel the\n\tC-level equivalent R_RegisterFinalizerEx.\n\n    o\trep() is now a primitive function and under some conditions\n\tvery much faster: rep.int() is still a little faster (but does\n\tless). (Because it is primitive there are minor changes to the\n\tcall semantics: see the help page.)\n\n    o\tThe 'row.names' of a data frame may be stored internally as an\n\tinteger or character vector.  This can result in considerably\n\tmore compact storage (and more logical row names from rbind)\n\twhen the row.names are 1:nrow(x).  However, such data frames\n\tare not compatible with earlier versions of R: this can be\n\tensured by supplying a character vector as 'row.names'.\n\n\trow.names() will always return a character vector, but direct\n\taccess to the attribute may not.\n\n\tThe internal storage of row.names = 1:n just records 'n', for\n\tefficiency with very long vectors.\n\n\tThe &quot;row.names&quot; attribute must be a character or integer\n\tvector, and this is now enforced by the C code.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;data.frame&quot; and &quot;matrix&quot; methods for rowsum() gain an 'na.rm'\n\targument.\n\n    o\tExperimental support for memory-use profiling via Rprof(),\n\tsummaryRprof(), Rprofmem() and tracemem().\n\n    o\tsave.image() [also called by sys.save.image() and hence from q()]\n\tnow defaults to saving compressed binary images.  To revert to\n\tthe previous behaviour set option &quot;save.image.defaults&quot;: see\n\t?save.image.\n\n    o\tThere is a new primitive seq.int() which is slightly more\n\trestricted than seq() but often very much faster, and new\n\tprimitives seq_along() and seq_len() which are faster still.\n\n    o\tserialize(connection = NULL) now returns a raw vector (and not\n\ta character string).  unserialize() accepts both old and new\n\tformats (and has since 2.3.0).\n\n    o\tsetwd() now returns the previously current directory (invisibly).\n\n    o\tThe function sort() is now sort.int(), with a new generic\n\tfunction sort() which behaves in the same way (except for the\n\torder of its argument list) for objects without a class, and\n\trelies on the '[' method for objects with a class (unless a\n\tspecific method has been written, as it has for class &quot;POSIXlt&quot;).\n\n    o\tsort.list() now implements complex vectors (PR#9039), and how\n\tcomplex numbers are sorted is now documented.\n\n    o\tspline() and splinefun() now follow approx[fun] to have an argument\n\t'ties = mean' which makes them applicable also when 'x' has\n\tduplicated values.\n\n    o\tstr(x) does not print the S3 &quot;class&quot; attribute when it is the\n\tsame as 'mode' (which is printed anyway, possibly abbreviated)\n\tand it puts it beside mode for atomic objects such as S3 class\n\t&quot;table&quot;.\n\n    o\tstr(&lt;data.frame&gt;) now outputs 'data.frame' instead of\n\t`data.frame'; this may affect some strict (Package) tests.\n\n    o\tstr() now takes also its defaults for 'vec.len' and 'digits.d'\n\tfrom options('str') which can be set by the new strOptions().\n\n    o\tsymnum() has a new argument 'numeric.x' particularly useful for\n\thandling 0/1 data.\n\n    o\tSys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() support LC_MESSAGES,\n\tLC_PAPER and LC_MEASUREMENT if the platform does.\n\n    o\tSweave has a new options 'pdf.encoding' and 'pdf.version' for\n\tits Rweave driver.\n\n    o\tThe character vector used by an output textConnection() has\n\ta locked binding whilst the connection is open.\n\n\tThere is a new function textConnectionValue() to retrieve the\n\tvalue of an output textConnection().\n\n    o\ttraceback() gains a 'max.lines' argument.\n\t.Traceback is no longer stored in the workspace.\n\n    o\twarning(immediate. = TRUE) now applies to\n\tgetOption(&quot;warn&quot;) &lt; 0 and not just == 0.\n\n    o\twarnings() is now an accessor function for 'last.warning' (which\n\tis no longer stored in the workspace) with a print() method.\n\n\n    o\tThe internal internet download functions have some new\n\tfeatures from libxml 2.6.26.\n\n    o\tThere is an option &quot;HTTPUserAgent&quot; to set the User Agent in R\n\tdownload requests etc.\tPatch from S. Falcon.\n\n    o\tPCRE has been updated to version 6.7.\n\n    o\tThe C function substituteList now has tail recursion expanded\n\tout, so C stack overflow is less likely.  (PR#8141, fix by\n\tKevin Hendricks)\n\n    o\tThe (somewhat soft) 1023/4 byte limit on command lines is now\n\tdocumented in 'An Introduction to R'.\n\n    o\tThe maximum number of open connections has been increased from\n\t50 to 128.\n\n    o\tThere is a new manual 'R Internals' on R internal stuctures\n\tplus the former appendices of 'Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tThe autoloads introduced at the package re-organization have been\n\talmost completely removed: the one that remains is for ts().\n\n    o\tThe setting of the various Java configuration variables has been\n\timproved to refer to JAVA_HOME, and they are now documented in\n\tthe R-admin manual.\n\n    o\tIt is (again) possible to calculate prediction intervals from\n\t&quot;lm&quot; objects for the original data frame, now with a warning\n\tthat the intervals refer to future observations.  Weighted\n\tintervals have also been implemented, with user-specifiable\n\tweights. Warnings are given in cases where the default\n\tbehaviour might differ from user expectations.  See the\n\t?predict.lm for details.\n\n\nCHANGES TO S4 METHODS\n\n    o\tThe default prototype object for S4 classes will have its own\n\tinternal type in 2.4.0, as opposed to being an empty list (the\n\tcause of several errors in the code up to 2.3.1).  Note that old\n\tbinary objects, including class definitions, will be\n\tinconsistent with the type, and should be recreated.\n\n    o\tS4 method dispatch has been completely revised to use cached\n\tgeneric functions and to search for the best match among\n\tinherited methods.  See ?Methods and\n\t<A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf\">http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf</A>\n\n    o\tObjects created from an S4 class are now marked by an internal flag,\n\ttested by isS4() in R and by macro IS_S4_OBJECT() in C.\t This\n\tis an efficient and reliable test, and should replace all\n\tearlier heuristic tests.\n\n    o\tSome changes have been made to automatic printing of S4\n\tobjects, to make this correspond to a call to show(), as per\n\t'Programming with Data'.\n\n    o\tS4 generic and class definitions are now cached when the related\n\tpackage is loaded.  This should improve efficiency and also\n\tavoid anomalous situations in which a class or generic cannot\n\tbe found.\n\n    o\ttrace() now creates a new S4 class for the traced object if\n\trequired.  This allows tracing of user-defined subclasses of\n\t&quot;function&quot;.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,\n\ttkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now defunct.\n\n    o\tArgument 'col' of bxp() has been removed: use 'boxfill'.\n\n    o\tUse of NULL as an environment is now an error.\n\n    o\tpostscriptFont() is defunct: use Type1Font().\n\n    o\tLa.chol() and La.chol2inv() are defunct (they were the same as\n\tthe default options of chol() and chol2inv).\n\n    o\tLa.svd(method = &quot;dgesvd&quot;) is defunct.\n\n    o\tFiles install.R and R_PROFILE.R in packages are now ignored\n\t(with a warning).\n\n    o\tThe following deprecated command-line options to INSTALL have\n\tbeen removed (use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):\n\t-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data\n\n    o\tGraphical parameter 'tmag' is obsolete.\n\n    o\tmauchley.test() (package 'stats') is now defunct.\n\n    o\tsymbol.C() and symbol.For() are deprecated.  They are required in\n\tS for use with is.loaded(), but are not so required in R.\n\n    o\tload()ing an object saved in one of the formats used prior to\n\tR 1.4.0 is deprecated.\tSuch objects should be re-saved in the\n\tcurrent format.\n\n    o\tsave(version = 1) is now deprecated.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tThe convenience function ScalarLogical now coerces all\n\tnon-zero non-NA values to TRUE.\n\n    o\tThe vector accessor functions such as INTEGER, REAL and\n\tSET_VECTOR_ELT now check that they are called on the\n\tcorrect SEXPTYPE (or at least on a compatible one).  See\n\t`Writing R Extensions' for the details and for a stricter\n\ttest regime.\n\n    o\tIt is no longer possible to pass list variables to\n\t.C(DUP = FALSE): it would have given rise to obscure garbage\n\tcollection errors.\n\n    o\tallocString is now a macro, so packages using it will need to\n\tbe reinstalled.\n\n    o\tR_ParseVector was returning with object(s) protected in the\n\tparser if the status was PARSE_INCOMPLETE or PARSE_ERROR.\n\n    o\tThere is a new function Rf_endEmbeddedR to properly terminate\n\ta session started by Rf_initEmbeddedR, and both are now\n\tavailable on Windows as well as on Unix-alikes.\t These and\n\trelated functions are declared in a new header &lt;Rembedded.h&gt;.\n\n\tIf R_TempDir is set when embedded R is initialized it is\n\tassumed to point to a valid session temporary directory: see\n\t`Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tThere is a new interface allowing one package to make C routines\n\tavailable to C code in other packages.\tThe interface consists\n\tof the routines R_RegisterCCallable and R_GetCCallable.\t These\n\tfunctions are declared in &lt;R_ext/Rdynload.h&gt;. This interface\n\tis experimental and subject to change.\n\n\tIn addition, a package can arrange to make use of header\n\tfiles in another (already installed) package via the\n\t'LinkingTo' field in the DESCRIPTION file: see 'Writing R\n\tExtensions'.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD SHLIB now handles (as linker commands) -L*, -l* and *.a.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now:\n\n\t- warns if there are non-ASCII characters in the R code (as\n\t  these will likely be syntax errors in some locale).\n\n\t- tests Rd cross-references by default, and tests for\n\t  (syntactically) valid CITATION metadata.\n\n\t- tests that the package can be loaded, and that the package\n\t  and namespace (if there is one) can each be loaded in\n\t  startup code (before the standard packages are loaded).\n\n\t- tests for empty 'exec' or 'inst' directories.\n\n\t- checks if $(FLIBS) is used when $(BLAS_LIBS) is.\n\n\t- checks that all packages (except non-S4-using standard\n\t  packages) used in ::, :::, library() and require() calls are\n\t  declared in the DESCRIPTION file, and 'methods' is declared if\n\t  S4 classes or methods are set.\n\n\t- throws an error if the standard packages 'methods' and\n\t  'stats4' are imported from in the NAMESPACE file and not\n\t  declared in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o\tThe test script produced by massage-Examples.pl no longer\n\tcreates objects in the base environment.\n\n    o\tNew utilties R CMD Stangle and R CMD Sweave for extracting S/R\n\tcode from and processing Sweave documentation, respectively.\n\n    o\tThe DESCRIPTION file of packages may contain an 'Enhances:'\n\tfield.\n\n    o\tAn R CMD javareconf script has been added to allow Java\n\tconfiguration to be updated even after R has been installed.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o\tThe C function realpath (used by normalizePath()) is hidden on\n\tsome systems and we try harder to find it.\n\n    o\tThere is a new option --enable-BLAS-shlib, which compiles the\n\tBLAS into a dynamic library -lRblas and links against that.\n\tFor the pros and cons see the R-admin manual.\n\n\tThe defaults are now --without-blas (so you have explicitly to\n\task for an external BLAS), and --enable-BLAS-shlib unless\n\ta usable external BLAS is found or on AIX or on MacOS X 10.2\n\tand earlier.\n\n    o\tMacOS X did not like having LSAME in both BLAS and LAPACK\n\tlibraries, so it is no longer part of the R-internal LAPACK.\n\tWe now require an external BLAS to provide LSAME: it seems\n\tthat nowadays all do.\n\n    o\tThe configure test for 'whether mixed C/Fortran code can be\n\trun' has been improved as on one system that test passed but\n\tthe Fortran run-time library was broken.\n\n    o\tA precious configure variable DEFS can be set to pass defines\n\t(e.g. -DUSE_TYPE_CHECKING_STRICT) to C code when compiling R.\n\n    o\tThere is now a test for visible __libc_stack_end on Linux\n\tsystems (since it is not visible on some recent glibc's\n\tbuilt from the sources).\n\n    o\tMacOS X 10.4 and higher now use two-level namespaces, single\n\tmodule in a shared library and allow undefined symbols to be\n\tresolved at run-time. This implies that common symbols are now\n\tallowed in package libraries. --enable-BLAS-shlib is supported\n\tfor internal BLAS, external BLAS framework and external static\n\tBLAS.  An external dynamic library BLAS is NOT supported. (But\n\tit can be easily used by replacing internal BLAS library file\n\tlater.)\t MacOS X &lt; 10.4 does not support --enable-BLAS-shlib.\n\n    o\tDynamic libraries and modules use a flat namespace on MacOS X\n\t10.4 and higher if either Xcode tools don't support dynamic\n\tlookup (Xcode &lt; 2.3) or the FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE environment\n\tvariable is set.  (The latter was introduced temporarily for\n\ttesting purposes and may go away anytime.)\n\n    o\tconfigure now defaults to 'run-time linking' on AIX\n\t(and AIX &lt; 4.2 is no longer allowed), using -bexpall rather\n\tthan export/import files.  If this works, it allows R to be\n\tbuilt in the same way as other Unix-alikes, including with R\n\tas a shared library and with a shared BLAS.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;mac.binary&quot; package type now defaults to universal\n\tbinary.  If a repository supports architecture-specific Mac\n\tbinaries, they can be requested by using &quot;mac.binary.xxx&quot; in\n\tcontrib.url(), where xxx is the desired architecture.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tThe name of a Fortran symbol reported to be missing by\n\t.Fortran() is now the actual name.  (What was reported to be\n\tan 'entry point' was missing the common leading underscore.)\n\n    o\tprint() on a MBCS character string now works properly a\n\tcharacter at a time rather than a byte at time.\t (This does\n\tnot affect MBCSs like UTF-8 and the Windows DBCSes which have\n\tnon-ASCII lead bytes and always worked correctly.)\n\n    o\tglm() now recalculates the null deviance whenever there is an\n\toffset (even if it is exactly zero to avoid a discontinuity in\n\tthat case, since the calculations with and without offset are\n\tdone by different algorithms).\n\n    o\tAmongst families, quasi() accepted an expression for link and\n\tno other did.  Now all accept an expression which evaluates to\n\ta one-element character vector (although e.g. 'logit' is taken\n\tas a name and not an expression).\n\n    o\ttrace() now accepts arguments where= and signature= for the\n\told-style trace (no tracer or exit, edit==FALSE) and just\n\tprints a message on entry.  Also the undocumented feature of\n\twhere=function now works for generic functions as well.\n\n    o\tcallNextMethod() failed for recursive use when the methods had\n\tnonstandard argument lists.  Now enforces the semantic rule\n\tthat the inheritance is fixed when the method containing the\n\tcallNextMethod() is installed.\tSee Details in the documentation.\n\n    o\tUseMethod() looked for the defining environment of 'generic' as\n\tif it were the current function, although some functions are\n\tgeneric for methods of a different generic.\n\n\tLookup for S3 methods is confined to functions: previously a\n\tnon-function 'fun.class' could have masked a function of the\n\tsame name.\n\n    o\tLine types (lty) specified as hex strings were documented not to\n\tallow zero, but some devices accepted zero and handled it in a\n\tdevice-dependent way.  Now it is an error on all devices.\n\t(PR#8914)\n\n    o\tSubassignment for a time series can no longer extend the series:\n\tit used to attempt to but failed to adjust the tsp attributes.\n\tNow window() must be used.\n\n    o\tFunction AIC() in package 'stats4' was not dispatching correctly\n\ton S4 classes via logLik() because of namespace issues.\n\n    o\tSubsetting LANGSXPs could break the call-by-value illusion.\n\t(PR#7924) (patch from Kevin Hendricks).\n\n    o\tparse() with n &gt; 1 gave a syntax error if fewer than n statements\n\twere available.\n\n    o\tparse() with n &gt; 1 gave strange results on some syntax errors.\n\t(PR#8815)\n\n    o\tlag.plot() now respects graphical parameters for the axes.\n\n    o\tUsing a wrong link in family() now gives more consistent error\n\tmessages.\n\n    o\tsort.list(method=&quot;radix&quot;) works on factors again.\n\n    o\tobject.size() is more accurate for vector objects (it takes into\n\taccount the smaller header and also the fixed sizes used in\n\tthe node classes for small vector objects).\n\n    o\taddmargins(T, ...) now returns a &quot;table&quot; when 'T' is a &quot;table&quot;, as\n\tits help page has always suggested.\n\n    o\tremove() now explicitly precludes removing variables from\n\tbaseenv() and throws an error (this was previously ignored).\n\n    o\tSaving the workspace at the end of a session now works as has\n\tlong been intended, that is it is saved only if something has\n\tbeen added/deleted/changed during the current session.\n\n    o\tThe search for bindings in &lt;&lt;-, -&gt;&gt; and assign(inherits=TRUE)\n\twas omitting the base package, although this was not\n\tdocumented.  Now the base package is included (but most\n\tbindings there are locked).\n\n    o\tdweibull(0, shape) was NaN not Inf for shape &lt; 1.  Also, the\n\thelp for dgamma and dweibull gave support as x &gt; 0, but\n\treturned non-zero values for x = 0.  (PR#9080)\n\n    o\tSubsetting arrays no longer preserves attributes (it was\n\tremoved for matrices in 1998).\n\n    o\tThe &quot;factor&quot; method of as.character() no longer maps level\n\t&quot;NA&quot; to &quot;&lt;NA&gt;&quot; (a legacy of before there were NA character\n\tstrings).\n\n    o\tterms(keep.order=TRUE) was not returning a valid &quot;order&quot;\n\tattribute.\n\n    o\tThe DLL registration code was not freeing .External symbols.\n\n    o\tThe internet download routines expected URLs of less than 4096\n\tbytes, but did not check.  Now this is checked, and http:// URLs\n\tare allowed to be up to 40960 bytes.\n\n    o\tparse(n=-1) threw a stack-imbalance error, and parse(n=3) did\n\tnot cope correctly with EOF during input.\n\n    o\tZero-column data frames had no names (rather than character(0)).\n\n    o\tby() and acf() could get confused when they used very long\n\texpressions as names.\n\n    o\tresiduals(&lt;glm object&gt;, type=&quot;working&quot;) was NA for cases with\n\tzero weight (whereas they are well-defined even though the\n\tcase was not used during the fitting) and the actual value is\n\tnow returned.  This allows residuals to be computed from fits\n\twith 'y = FALSE'.\n\n\tThe residuals in a fitted &quot;glm&quot; object are computed more\n\taccurately: the previous formula was subject to cancellation.\n\n    o\tloess() now checks the validity of its 'control' argument.\n\n    o\trownames(&lt;0-row matrix&gt;, do.NULL=FALSE) was wrong.  (PR#9136)\n\n    o\tapply() now works as documented when applied over 2 or more\n\tmargins with one of zero extent.  (It used to drop dimensions.)\n\n    o\thead() and tail() now also work row-wise for &quot;table&quot; and &quot;ftable&quot;\n\tobjects.\n\n    o\tNextMethod() could throw an error/crash if called from a method\n\tthat was called directly rather than from a generic (so\n\t.Method was unset).\n\n    o\torder(x, na.last = NA) failed for a zero-length x.\n\n    o\tgrep(pat, x, value = TRUE, perl = L) preserved names for\n\tL == TRUE &amp;&amp; !is.na(pat) but not otherwise.  Now it always does.\n\n    o\t[rc]bind() now find registered methods and not just visible ones.\n\n    o\tPrinting a factor no longer ignores attributes such as names and\n\tdim/dimnames.\n\n    o\tCommand-line arguments after --encoding were ignored.\n\n    o\tThe check for impossible confidence levels was off by one in\n\twilcox.test (PR#8557)\n\n    o\t[[ on an environment could create aliases. (PR#8457)\n\n    o\tpt() with a very small (or zero) non-centrality parameter could\n\tgive an unduly stringent warning about 'full precision was not\n\tachieved'.

(Functions such as lines() and\n\tpoints() allow them to be of length &gt; 1, so they might be\n\tpassed through ... to other high-level graphical functions\n\twhich then used to reject them.)\n\n    o\tstr() now is fast again for large character vectors.\n\n    o\tedit() would default the environment of a function to .BaseEnv,\n\tinstead of to .GlobalEnv.\n\n    o\tlm() and glm() coerce their 'weights' and 'offset' values to\n\tvector to avoid problems with specifying them as 1D or n x 1\n\tarrays.\n\n    o\timage() with one or both axes on log scales would give a\n\tspurious warning; contour() would give an error.\n\n    o\tlegend() with log axes would place the title in the wrong place.\n\n    o\tedit.data.frame() was not returning factors edited with\n\tfactor.mode=&quot;numeric&quot; to factors.\n\n    o\tedit.matrix() tried to set rownames and colnames from the\n\toriginal matrix even if the sizes had been altered, and\n\tignored changes made to the column names.  edit.row.names has\n\ta more sensible default (if the rownames are non-NULL).\n\n    o\tbindingIsLocked() was returning invalid values of a logical\n\tvector on some platforms.\n\n    o\tmerge.data.frame() did not make the column names unique (by\n\tappending elements of 'suffixes') when performing a Cartesian\n\tproduct.  (PR#8676)\n\n    o\trbind.data.frame() matches up the names of columns (which was\n\tundocumented), but failed to do so when checking if it was\n\tdealing with a factor column.  (PR#8868)\n\n\tIf rbind() was used on data frames with duplicated names it\n\tproduced a corrupt data frame.\n\n    o\tdt(x, df, ncp= not.0) now longer gives erratic values for\n\t|x| &lt; ~1e-12.  (PR#8874)\n\n    o\t\\code{\\linkS4class{.}} now works.\n\n    o\tccf() aligns time series by ts.intersect() rather than\n\tts.union() and so is less likely to need a non-default\n\tna.action.  (PR#8893)\n\n    o\toptim(method=&quot;CG&quot;) could return a value that did not\n\tcorrespond to $par for very badly behaved functions on which\n\tthe second phase of the line search failed.

Since this is an invalid name, it is less likely\n\tto clash with names given to transformed variables. (People\n\twere getting into trouble with transform(data, x=y+z).)\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tarima.sim() has a new argument 'start.innov' for compatibility\n\twith S-PLUS.  (If not supplied, the output is unchanged from\n\tprevious versions in R.)\n\n    o\tarrows() has been changed to be more similar to segments():\n\tfor example col=NA omits the arrow rather than as previously\n\t(undocumented) using par(&quot;col&quot;).\n\n    o\tas.list() now accepts symbols (as given by as.symbol() aka\n\tas.name()).\n\n    o\tatan2() now allows one complex and one numeric argument.\n\n    o\tThe 'masked' warnings given by attach() and library() now only\n\twarn for functions masking functions or non-functions masking\n\tnon-functions.\n\n    o\tNew function Axis(), a generic version of axis(), with Date and\n\tPOSIX[cl]t methods.  This is used by most of the standard\n\tplotting functions (boxplot, contour, coplot, filled.contour,\n\tpairs, plot.default, rug, stripchart) which will thus label x\n\tor y axes appropriately.\n\n    o\tpbeta() now uses TOMS708 in all cases and so is more accurate\n\tin some (e.g. when lower.tail = FALSE and when one of the\n\tshape parameters is very small).\n\n    o\t[qr]beta(), [qr]f() and [qr]t() now have a non-centrality parameter.\n\n    o\t[rc]bind and some more cases of subassignment are implemented\n\tfor raw matrices.  (PR8529 and 8530)\n\n    o\tThe number of lines of deparsed calls printed by browser() and\n\ttraceback() can be limited by the option &quot;deparse.max.lines&quot;.\n\t(Wish of PR#8638.)\n\n    o\tNew canCoerce() utility function in &quot;methods&quot; package.\n\n    o\t[pq]chisq() are considerably more accurate for moderate (up to\n\t80) values of ncp, and lower.tail = FALSE is fully supported\n\tin that region.  (They are somewhat slower than before.)\n\n    o\tchol(pivot = TRUE) now gives a warning if used on a (numerically)\n\tnon-positive-definite matrix.\n\n    o\tchooseCRANmirror() consults the CRAN master (if accessible) to\n\tfind an up-to-date list of mirrors.\n\n    o\tcov.wt() is more efficient for 'cor = TRUE' and has a new 'method'\n\targument which allows 'Maximum Likelihood'.\n\n    o\tdo.call() gains an 'envir' argument.\n\n    o\teigen() applied to an asymmetric real matrix now uses a\n\ttolerance to decide if the result is complex (rather than\n\texpecting the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues to be exactly\n\tzero).\n\n    o\tNew function embedFonts() for embedding fonts in PDF or\n\tPostScript graphics files.\n\n    o\tfisher.test() now uses p-values computed via hypergeometric\n\tdistributions for all 2 by 2 tables.  This might be slightly\n\tslower for a few cases, but works much better for tables with\n\tsome large counts.\n\n\tThere is a new option to simulate the p-value for larger than\n\t2 x 2 tables.\n\n    o\tfor() now supports raw vectors as the set of indices.\n\n    o\tgetNativeSymbolInfo() is vectorized for the 'name' argument.  It\n\treturns a named list of NativeSymbolInfo objects, but is\n\tbackward compatible by default when called with a character\n\tvector of length 1, returning the NativeSymbolInfo object.\n\n    o\thelp.search() no longer attempts to handle packages installed\n\tprior to R 2.0.0, and reports the current path to the\n\tpackage (rather than where it was originally installed: this\n\tinformation is not shown by the print() method).\n\n    o\tAdded &quot;hexmode&quot; to parallel &quot;octmode&quot;.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() now does tilde expansion on file paths\n\tsupplied as 'pkgs'.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() has additional arguments 'configure.args' and\n\t'clean' which allow the caller to provide additional arguments\n\tto the underlying R CMD INSTALL shell command when installing\n\tsource packages on a Unix-alike.\n\n    o\tis.loaded() has a new argument 'type' to confine the search to\n\tsymbols for .C, .Fortran, .Call or .External: by default it\n\tlooks for a symbol which will match any of them.  It is now\n\tinternal and not primitive, so argument matching works in the\n\tusual way.\n\n    o\tThe symmetry test for matrices used in eigen() has been ``exported''\n\tas the 'matrix' method of a new S3-generic 'isSymmetric().\n\n    o\t.leap.seconds and the internal adjustment code now know about\n\tthe 23rd leap second on 2005-12-31: the internal code uses a\n\trun-time test to see if the OS does.\n\n    o\tThe 'col' argument of legend() now defaults to par(&quot;col&quot;)\n\t(which defaults to &quot;black&quot;, the previous default), so that\n\tthe lines/symbols are shown in the legend in the colour that\n\tis used on the plot.\n\n    o\tlog2() and log10() call C functions of the same name if\n\tavailable, and will then be more likely to be precise to\n\tmachine accuracy.\n\n    o\tnew.packages() gains a ... argument to pass e.g. 'destdir' to\n\tinstall.packages().  (Wish of PR#8239.)\n\n    o\tnls() now supports 'weights'.\n\n    o\tThe vector passed as the first argument of the 'fn' and 'gr'\n\targuments of optim() has the names (if any) given to argument\n\t'par'.\n\n    o\toptions(expressions) is temporarily increased by 500 during\n\terror-handling.\t  This enables e.g. traceback() to work when\n\tthe error is reaching the limit on the nesting of expressions.\n\n    o\tpage() accepts general R objects, not just names (and\n\tpreviously undocumented) character strings.  This allows the\n\tobject to be specified as a call, for example.  More options\n\tare allowed in its '...' argument.\n\n    o\tpairs() allows a wider class of inputs, including data frames\n\twith date and date-time columns.\n\n    o\tpar() and the in-line use of graphical parameters produce more\n\tinformative error messages, distinguishing between\n\tnon-existent pars and inappropriate use of valid pars.\n\n\tGraphical parameters 'family', 'lend', 'ljoin' and 'lmitre'\n\tcan now be set in-line.\n\n\tThere is no longer a warning if non-settable pars are used\n\tin-line, but there is an appropriate warning if unknown pars\n\tare passed.\n\n\tThe length limit for the 'family' parameter has been increased\n\tto 200 bytes, to allow for the names of some CID-keyed fonts\n\tin multi-byte locales.\n\n    o\tThe pdf() device now allows 'family' to be specified in the same\n\tgenerality as postscript().\n\n    o\tThe pdf() device writes /FontDescriptor entries for all fonts\n\texcept the base 14, and does not write font entries for unused\n\tfonts.\n\n    o\tPlotmath allows 'vartheta', 'varphi' and 'varsigma' (or 'stigma')\n\tas synonyms for 'theta1', 'phi1' and 'sigma1', and the help\n\tpage has a note for TeX users.\n\n    o\tplot.xy() now takes its default arguments from the\n\tcorresponding par() settings, so points(type=&quot;l&quot;) and\n\tlines(type=&quot;p&quot;) behave in the same way (and more obviously,\n\talso for type=&quot;b&quot;).\n\n    o\tpoly() has a new argument 'raw', mainly for pedagogical purposes.\n\n    o\tThe class &quot;POSIXlt&quot; now supports fractional seconds (as\n\t&quot;POSIXct&quot; has always done).  The printing of fractional seconds\n\tis controlled by the new option &quot;digits.secs&quot;, and by default is off.\n\n    o\tpostscript() supports family = &quot;ComputerModernItalic&quot; for\n\tComputer Modern with italic (rather than slanted) faces.\n\n    o\tThe postscript()/pdf() font metrics for the 14 standard fonts\n\t(only, not the rest of the common 35) have been updated to\n\tversions from late 1999 which cover more glyphs.  There are\n\talso a few differences in the metrics and hence the output\n\tmight be slightly different in some cases.\n\n    o\tThe way families can be specified for postscript() and pdf()\n\thas been expanded to include CID-keyed fonts, with new\n\tfunctions Type1Font() and CIDFont() to set up such fonts\n\tfamilies.\n\n    o\tprettyNum() has new arguments 'preserve.width' and 'zero.print'.\n\tWhen the former is not &quot;none&quot;, as in calls from format() and\n\tformatC(), the resulting strings are kept at the desired width\n\twhen possible even after adding of 'big.mark' or 'small.mark'.\n\n    o\tproc.time() and system.time() now record times to 1ms accuracy\n\twhere available (most Unix-like systems).\n\n    o\tThe initialization methods for the quasi() family have been\n\tchanged to depend on the variance function, and in particular\n\tto work better for the &quot;mu(1-mu)&quot; variance function.  (PR#8486)\n\n    o\tread.table() gains a 'flush' argument passed to scan().\n\n    o\trequire() now takes a 'lib.loc' argument.\n\n    o\tThe second argument 'size' to sample() is required to have\n\tlength 1, so that errors when supplying arguments are more\n\teasily detected.\n\n    o\tThe default is now compress = !ascii in save() (but not save.image).\n\n    o\tscan() and write.table() now have some interruptibility, which\n\tmay be useful when processing very large files.\n\n    o\tA new heuristic test, seemsS4Object() is supplied, along with a\n\tsimilar C-level test, R_seemsS4Object(object). The test\n\tdetects probable S4 objects by their class's attribute. See\n\tthe help page.\n\n    o\tS3 classes can now be made non-virtual S4 classes by supplying a\n\tprototype object in the arguments to setOldClass().\n\n    o\tsplinefun() returns a function that now also has a 'deriv' argument\n\tand can provide up to the 3rd derivative of the interpolating\n\tspline, thanks to Berwin Turlach.\n\t\n    o\tstopifnot(A) now gives a better error message when A has NAs, and\n\tuses &quot;not all TRUE&quot; when A has length &gt;= 2.\n\n    o\tstr()'s default method has a new argument 'strict.width' which can\n\tbe used to produce strict 'width' conforming output.  A new\n\toptions(str = list(strict.width = *)) setting allows to control\n\tthis for a whole session.\n\n    o\tsummary.nls() has a new argument 'correlation' that defaults\n\tto FALSE (like summary.lm).\n\n    o\tSys.sleep() has sub-millisecond resolution on Unix-alikes\n\twith gettimeofday().\n\n    o\tSys.time() now has sub-millisecond accuracy on systems\n\tsupporting the POSIX call gettimeofday, and clock-tick\n\taccuracy on Windows.\n\n    o\tThe new function timestamp() adds a time stamp to the saved\n\tcommand history on consoles which support it.\n\n    o\tNew function tcrossprod() for efficiently computing x %*% t(x)\n\tand x %*% t(y).\n\n    o\tThe suffix used by tempfile() is now in hex on all platforms\n\tand guaranteed to be at least 6 hex digits (usually 8).\n\n    o\ttrace() now works more consistently and more like its\n\tdocumentation, in particular the assertions about old tracing\n\tbeing removed for new.\tFor debugging purposes (of R) a\n\tmechanism for debugging the trace computations themselves was\n\tadded.\tSee trace.R.\n\n    o\tThe implementation of trace() has beem made more general by\n\tcalling a function to do the trace interaction, and recover()\n\tnow detects trace calls to trim the irrelevant code underneath.\n\n    o\tunserialize() can now also read a byte stream from a raw vector.\n\n    o\tThe useDynLib() directive in the NAMESPACE file now accepts the\n\tnames of the native/foreign symbols that are to be resolved in\n\tthe DLL for use in .C/.Call/.Fortran/.External calls.  These\n\tcan be used as regular R variables instead of the (routine\n\tname, PACKAGE) pairs currently recommended.  Alternative names\n\tcan be given for the R variables mapping to these symbols.\n\tThe native routine registration information can also be used\n\tdirectly via useDynLib(name, .registration = TRUE).  See the\n\t'Writing R Extensions' manual for more details.\n\n\tcheckFF() (package 'tools') has been updated accordingly.\n\n    o\tvalidObject() has an option complete=TRUE that recursively\n\tchecks the objects in the slots.  Not used when new(...)\n\tchecks validity.\n\n    o\tNew Vectorize() function, a wrapper for mapply().\n\n    o\twrite.ftable() has gained an argument 'append = FALSE' (thanks to\n\tStephen Weigand).\n\n    o\tOn Unix-alikes, X11() now has arguments to request the initial\n\tposition of the window, and 'gamma' defaults to the value of\n\tgetOptions(&quot;gamma&quot;).  These changes are consistent with the\n\twindows() device.\n\n    o\tX11() and the Unix-alike data entry window can have properties\n\t(including geometry) set by X resources: see their help files.\n\n    o\txy.coords() &amp; xyz.coords() now have NULL defaults for their 'y' or\n\t'y' and 'z' arguments.\tThis is more consistent with their earlier\n\tdocumentation, and may be convenient for using them.\n\n\n    o\tNon-syntactic names of list elements are now printed quoted by\n\tbackticks rather than double quotes.\n\n    o\tThere is some basic checking for imminent C stack overflow (when\n\tthe evaluation depth and the user interrupts are checked).\n\tOn systems with suitable OS support (not Windows), segfaults\n\tfrom C stack overflow are caught and treated as an R error.\n\n\tNew function Cstack_info() reports on stack size and usage.\n\n    \toptions(expressions) reverts to the default of 5000 now\n\tstack checking is in place.\n\n    o\tPackage tcltk does not try to initialize Tk on Unix-alikes\n\tunless a DISPLAY variable is present.  This allows packages\n\tdependent on tcltk to be installed without access to an X server.\n\n    o\tThe code used to guess timezone offsets where not supplied by\n\tthe OS uses a different algorithm that is more likely to guess\n\tthe summer-time transitions correctly.\n\n    o\tPackage tools contains translation tables 'Adobe_glyphs' and\n\t'charset_to_Unicode'.\n\n    o\tChanged the environment tree to be rooted in an empty\n\tenvironment, available as emptyenv().  baseenv() has been\n\tmodified to return an environment with emptyenv() as parent,\n\trather than NULL.\n\n    o\tgettext has been updated to 0.14.5.\n\n    o\tPCRE has been updated to version 6.4.\n\n    o\tThe method $.DLLInfo resolves the specified symbol in the DLL,\n\treturning a NativeSymbolInfo object.  Use [[ to access the actual\n\tvalues in the DLLInfo object.\n\n    o\tOn systems with either vasprintf or both va_copy and a vsnprintf\n\twhich reports the size of buffer required, connections such as\n\tgzfile() and bzfile() can now write arbitrarily long lines,\n\tnot just 100000 chars.\n\n    o\tThe R session temporary directory is now set in C code using\n\tthe same algorithm whether or not the shell front-end is used\n\tand on all platforms.  This looks at environment variables\n\tTMPDIR, TMP and TEMP in turn, and checks if they point to a\n\twritable directory.\n\n    o\tSome of the classical tests put unnecessary restrictions on the\n\tLHS in the formula interface (e.g., t.test(x+y ~ g) was not\n\tallowed).\n\n    o\tOn suitably equipped Unix-alike systems, segfaults, illegal\n\toperations and bus errors are caught and there is a simple\n\terror-handler which gives the user some choice as to what to\n\tdo in interactive use. [Experimental.]\n\n\tOn Windows access violations and illegal instructions are\n\tcaught with a simple error handler.  [Experimental.]\n\n    o\tTracebacks now include calls such as .C/.Fortran/.Call, which\n\twill help if errors occur in R code evaluated by compiled code\n\tand in tracebacks presented by the segfault etc handlers.\n\n    o\tTreatment of signature objects and method definition objects has\n\tbeen modified to give cleaner printing and more consistency in\n\tthe treatment of signatures.  A sometimes useful utility,\n\tmethodSignatureMatrix(), is now exported.\n\n    o\tR refrains from printing a final EOL upon exiting the main loop\n\tif the quiet flag is on and if the save action is known (e.g. this\n\tis true for --slave).\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe deprecated and undocumented use of atan() with two arguments\n\thas been removed: instead use atan2().\n\n    o\twrite.table0() is defunct in favour of write.table().\n\n    o\tformat.char() is defunct in favour of format.default().\n\n    o\tSupport for the long-deprecated (and no longer documented)\n\targuments --min-vsize --min-nsize --max-vsize --max-nsize\n\t--vsize --nsize of R CMD BATCH has been removed.\n\n    o\tThe 'debian' subdirectory has been removed from the sources.\n\n    o\tThe 'vfont' argument of axis() and mtext() has been removed:\n\tuse par(family=) instead.\n\n    o\tThe unused graphical parameter &quot;type&quot; has been removed: it\n\tinvited confusion with the 'type' argument to default methods\n\tof plot(), points() and lines().\n\n    o\tnlsMethod() and profiler() are no longer exported from the stats\n\tnamespace (and nlsMethod.plinear() is no longer registered as\n\ta method, as nlsMethod() was not generic).\n\n    o\tThe re-named tcltk functions tkcmd, tkfile.tail, tkfile.dir,\n\ttkopen, tkclose, tkputs, tkread are now formally deprecated.\n\n    o\tArgument 'col' of bxp() is now formally deprecated.\n\n    o\tUse of NULL as an environment is deprecated and gives a warning.\n\n    o\tpostscriptFont() is deprecated in favour of Type1Font() (which\n\tis just a change of name).\n\n    o\tLa.chol() and La.chol2inv() are deprecated (they have since R\n\t1.7.0 been the same as the default options of chol() and chol2inv).\n\n    o\tLa.svd(method = &quot;dgesvd&quot;) is deprecated.\n\n    o\tThe use of install.R and R_PROFILE.R files in packages is\n\tdeprecated: use the DESCRIPTION file instead to arrange to\n\tsave an image or to load dependent packages.\n\n\tThe following command-line options to INSTALL are deprecated\n\t(use the fields in the DESCRIPTION file instead):\n\t-s --save --no-save --lazy --no-lazy --lazy-data --no-lazy-data\n\n    o\tGraphical parameter 'tmag' (which is long unused) is deprecated.\n\n\nINTERNATIONALIZATION\n\n\tA set of patches supplied by Ei-ji Nakama has been incorporated.\n\n    o\tNew postscript encodings for CP1253, CP1257 and Greek (ISO 8859-7).\n\n    o\tSupport for East Asian CID-keyed fonts in pdf() and postscript().\n\tAlthough these usually contain Latin characters no accurate\n\tAFMs are available and so CID-keyed fonts are intended only\n\tfor use with CJK characters.\n\n    o\tWide-character width functions wc[s]width are provided that\n\tovercome problems found with OS-supplied ones (and those\n\tpreviously used by R on Windows).  This means that\n\tdouble-width CJK characters are now supported on all\n\tplatforms.  It seems that the width of some characters (and\n\tnot just CJK characters) depends on which CJK locale's fonts\n\tare in use and also on the OS.\n\n\tRevised wide-character classification functions are\n\tprovided for use on Windows, AIX and MacOS X to replace\n\tdeficient OS-supplied ones.\n\n   o\tThere is support for MBCS charsets in the pictex() graphics\n\tdevice, and rotated (by 90 degrees) text may work better.\n\n   o\tThe \\u (and \\U except on Windows) notation for characters which\n\tis supported by the parser in all MBCS charsets is now always\n\tinterpreted as a Unicode point, even on platforms which do not\n\tencode wchar_t in Unicode.  These are now a syntax error in\n\tsingle-byte locales.\n\n    o\tThe default encoding for postscript() and pdf() is chosen to\n\tbe suitable for the current locale, if that is a single-byte\n\tlocale which is supported.  This covers European (including\n\tGreek) and Cyrillic languages.\n\n\tIn UTF-8 locales, a suitable single-byte encoding is chosen\n\tfor postscript() and pdf(), and text translated to it.\n\n    o\txfig() gains an 'encoding' argument.\n\n    o\tThere are some message translations into Spanish.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe encoding files for pdf()/postscript() have been moved to\n\tdirectory 'enc' in package 'grDevices'.\n\n    o\tSupport for MBCS is only enabled if iconv is found and it\n\tsupports enough conversions.  (libiconv does.)\n\n    o\tIn an MBCS locale, make check now translates the graphics\n\texamples from Latin-1.\tThis ensures that they will work\n\tcorrectly in UTF-8: it is possible that in other MBCS locales\n\tthey will now fail (rather than work completely incorrectly).\n\n    o\tThere is a new test, 'test-Docs', which as part of 'make\n\tcheck-devel' tests the code in the documentation.  Currently\n\tit runs doc/manual/R-{exts,intro}.R and the compiled code in\n\tR-exts.c.\n\n    o\tThe workaround to allow an external LAPACK-containing BLAS\n\tsuch as libsunperf to be used with the internal LAPACK has\n\tbeen removed.  If you have such a library you may now need\n\tto use --with-lapack.  It is no longer possible to use some\n\tolder versions of libsunperf, e.g. Forte 7 on 64-bit builds.\n\n    o\tA substitute for mkdtemp is provided, so it is now always\n\tused for R_TempDir.\n\n    o\tMost of the functions checked for by 'configure' also have\n\tdeclarations checked for in the appropriate header.\n\n    o\tThe top-level documentation files AUTHORS COPYING.LIB COPYRIGHTS\n\tFAQ RESOURCES THANKS have been moved to doc, and COPYING and NEWS\n\tare installed there.  The file Y2K has been removed from the\n\tdistribution.\n\n    o\tThe extension .lo is no longer used in building R (only in\n\tthe optional build of libRmath.so): this allows a considerable\n\tsimplification of the Makefiles.\n\n    o\tDirect support for f2c has been removed: it can still be used\n\tvia a script which makes it look like a Fortran compiler.\n\t(src/scripts/f77_f2c is an example of such a script.)\n\n    o\tThere is a new flag SAFE_FFLAGS which is used for the\n\tcompilation of dlamc.f.\t It is set by configure for known\n\tproblem cases (recent g77 and gfortran), but can be overridden\n\tby the user.\n\n    o\tThe standard autoconf macros for large-file support are now used,\n\tand these are enabled unless --disable-largefile is specified.\n\tThis replaces --enable-linux-lfs (and is now selected by default).\n\n    o\tVisibility attributes are used where supported (gcc4/gfortran on\n\tsome platforms, also gcc3/g77 on FC3 and partially elsewhere).\n\tThe main benefit should be faster loading (and perhaps better\n\toptimized code) in some of the dynamic shared objects (e.g.\n\tlibR.so and stats.so).\n\n    o\tThe *PICFLAGS are taken to be -fpic rather than -fPIC where\n\tpossible.   This will make no difference on most platforms:\n\t-fPIC is needed on Sparc (and still used there), but -fpic\n\tshould give slightly better performance on PowerPC (although\n\t-fPIC is used on PPC64 as it is needed to build libR.so there).\n\n    o\tMore use is made of inlining for small utility functions such\n\tas isReal.  Because this can only be done portably with C99\n\tconstructs (and we know of no actual implementation), this is\n\tonly done for the GNU C compiler.\n\n    o\tThere is an experimental feature to allow shared installations\n\tof sub-architectures.  See the R-admin manual.\n\n    o\tAll platforms now use R's internal implementation of strptime,\n\twhich allows fractional seconds.  (The major platforms were\n\talready using it.)\n\n    o\tThe dlcompat work-around for old Mac OS X systems (&lt;= 10.2)\n\thas been removed.  External dlcompat must be installed if needed.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD check now uses an install log by default.\n\n    o\tR CMD check works for packages whose package name is different\n\tfrom the directory name in which it is located.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL now uses more randomness in the temporary\n\tdirectory name even on systems without mktemp -d.\n\n    o\tR CMD f77 has been removed now f2c is no longer supported.\n\n    o\tThe version string shown in the startup message and by\n\t&quot;R --version&quot;, and that stored in variable R.version.string\n\tare now in exactly the same format.\n\n    o\tThe base name of a help file needs to be valid as part of a file://\n\tURL, so R CMD check now checks the names are ASCII and do not\n\tcontain % .\n\n    o\tR CMD check now warns about unknown sections in Rd files, and\n\tinvalid names for help, demo and R files, as well as unlikely\n\tfile names in the 'src' directory.  The latter is controlled\n\tby option --check-subdirs and by default is done if checking a\n\ttarball without a configure script.\n\n\tR CMD build excludes invalid files in the 'man', 'R' and 'demo'\n\tsubdirectories.\n\n    o\t\\usepackage[noae]{Sweave} in the header of an Sweave file\n\tsupresses auto-usage of the ae package (&quot;almost European&quot;\n\tfonts) and T1 input encoding.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n    o\tRd format now allows \\var{} markup inside \\code{} and \\examples{}.\n\n    o\tMarkup such as --, ---, &lt; and &gt; is handled better when\n\tconverting .Rd files to [C]HTML.\n\n    o\tThere is new markup \\link[=dest]{name} to generate a link to topic\n\t'dest' which is shown as 'name', and \\linkS4class{abc} which\n\texpands to \\link[=abc-class]{abc}, for cross-referencing the\n\trecommended form of documentation for S4 classes.\n\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION\n\n    o\tThere is now some support for Fortran 90/95 code in packages:\n\tsee `Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tInstallation of man sources and demos is now done by R code.\n\tThe restrictions on the names of help files, R files and\n\tof demos are now enforced (see `Writing R Extensions').\n\n    o\tPackages which contain compiled code can now have more than\n\tone dot in their name even on Windows.\n\n    o\tThe Meta/hsearch.rds database saved now contains LibPath=&quot;&quot;.\n\tThis information is now always recreated when help.search() is\n\trun, but the field is retained for back-compatibility.\n\n    o\tupdate.packages() now has a '...' argument to be passed to\n\tinstall.packages(), including the formerly separate arguments\n\t'destdir' and 'installWithVers'.\n\n    o\tMake macros AR and RANLIB are now declared in etc/Makeconf for\n\tuse by packages which wish to make static libraries.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tqgamma and rgamma in Rmath.h now check for non-positive arguments.\n\n    o\tThe BLAS which ships with R now contains the complete set of\n\tdouble-complex BLAS routines, rather than just those used in R.\n\n\t&lt;R_ext/BLAS.h&gt; has been corrected to add the missing\n\tdouble-precision BLAS functions drotmg and drotm, and to\n\texclude lsame (which is a Lapack auxiliary function and is now\n\tdeclared in &lt;R_ext/Lapack.h&gt;).\tIt also includes the double\n\tcomplex routines added for this release of R provided Fortran\n\tdoublecomplex is usable on the platform.\n\n    o\t&lt;R_ext/BLAS.h&gt; and &lt;R_ext/Lapack.h&gt; now declare all the entry\n\tpoints as 'extern'.\n\n    o\tThe flag SAFE_FFLAGS is made available to packages via\n\tetc/Makeconf and R CMD config.\tIt can be used where\n\toptimization needs to be defeated, e.g. in LAPACK setup.\n\n    o\tgetNativeSymbolInfo has a withRegistrationInfo argument which\n\tcauses the address field to be a reference to the registration\n\tinformation if it is available for that symbol.\t If the\n\tregistration information is not available, the address is a\n\treference to the native symbol. The default is FALSE which is\n\tbackward compatible, returning just the address of the symbol\n\tand ignoring registration information.\n\n    o\terrorcall and warningcall are now declared in &lt;Rinternals.h&gt;\n\t(they might be needed in front-ends).\n\n    o\tR_FlushConsole and R_ProcessEvents are now declared in &lt;R.h&gt;.\n\n    o\tThe R_Sock* functions supporting socket connections are no\n\tlonger declared in R-ftp-http.h as they are not loaded into R\n\titself, and are now hidden in the module's DLL on suitable systems.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tQuoted arguments to the R script after --args are now\n\tpassed quoted to the R executable and so will be shown as\n\texpected by commandArgs().  (They were previously split at\n\twhitespace even inside quotes on Unix-alikes but not on\n\tWindows.)\n\n    o\taxis() now supports pars 'xaxp'/'yaxp' as inline arguments.\n\n    o\tsort() now does not return inappropriate attributes such as\n\t&quot;dim&quot; and &quot;tsp&quot;: it only returns names.\n\n\tsort(x, partial=) no longer returns unsorted names, and drops\n\tnames (since it is supplied for efficiency).\n\n    o\tUse of non-central F in pf() gives accurate values for larger ncp.\n\n    o\tR CMD build --binary does a better job of cleaning up after\n\tfailure to re-make vignettes.\n\n    o\treg-test-1.R tested system(intern=TRUE) which depends on popen\n\tand so is not supported on all platforms.\n\n    o\tChanged apparent mis-spelling of &quot;Gibraltar&quot; in dataset 'eurodist'.\n\n    o\tsysconf() is now used to find the number of clock ticks/second:\n\tunder some circumstances glibc reported CLK_TCK = 60 when the\n\ttrue value was 100.\n\n    o\tidentical() was not allowing for embedded nuls in character\n\tstrings. (NB: the comparison operators including == do not,\n\tand never will.)\n\n    o\tThe profile() and profiler() methods for &quot;nls&quot; objects now\n\tsupport algorithm = &quot;plinear&quot; and algorithm = &quot;port&quot;.\n\n    o\tThe signal handlers for signals USR1 and USR2 where not\n\trestored if the signal arrived when interrupts were suspended.\n\n    o\tCertain combinations of S4 inheritance could cause inherited\n\tmethods to override some directly specified methods.\n\n    o\tSome cases of named signatures in calls to setMethod() caused errors.\n\n    o\tall.equal() is now more consistent and &quot;picky&quot; about mismatching\n\tattributes, in particular names(); this is a part of the\n\tpropositions by Andy Piskorkski (PR#8191).\n\n    o\tload() when applied to a connection leaves it open/not as it\n\tfound it, and checks explicitly for having a binary readable\n\tconnection.\n\n    o\tThe p-values given by stat.anova() (called from several\n\tanova() methods) are now NA (rather than spurious) if\n\tnon-nested models give rise to changes in deviance with a\n\tdifferent sign from changes in degrees of freedom.\n\n    o\tBuilt-ins were reported as the relevant call in C-level error()s\n\tiff R profiling was in progress.  Now they are never reported.\n\n    o\tToo-long signatures (with no names) were not being caught\n\tin setMethod().\n\n    o\tSlot names in prototype() are being more thoroughly checked.\n\n    o\tsignif() is more likely to follow the 'round to even' rule for\n\texactly representable numbers, e.g. signif(0.25, 1).  (Related\n\tto PR#8452.)\n\n    o\tnls() now works correctly with some low-dimensional fits,\n\te.g. with one or zero non-linear parameters.\n\n    o\tglm() could give an inappropriate error message if all\n\tpossible coefficients were invalid (e.g. a log-linear binomial\n\tmodel with no intercept and a not all positive predictor).\n\n    o\tsolve() gives clearer error messages for some incorrect usages.\n\t(PR#8494 and similar)\n\n    o\tThe gaussian() family was missing the 'valideta' component\n\t(which could be needed for the &quot;inverse&quot; link function).\n\n\tThe starting values supplied by the gaussian family could be\n\tinvalid for the &quot;log&quot; and &quot;inverse&quot; link functions.  This is\n\tnow reported.\n\n    o\tdata.matrix() did not work correctly on zero-row data frames.\n\t(PR#8496 and other problems.)\n\n    o\tThe DSC comments in the files from postscript(onefile=FALSE) now\n\tlabel all files as having page 1 of 1, as some other software\n\tseems to expect that.\n\n    o\tThe axis labels chosen for logarithmic axis are now less\n\tlikely to be linear and inappropriate (when the range is more\n\tthan 10 and less than 100).  (PR#1235)\n\n    o\tStaircase lines (types &quot;s&quot; and &quot;S&quot;) are now drawn\n\tcontinuously rather than a point at a time and so line types,\n\tmitring and so on work. (PR#2630)\n\n    o\tCalling par(mfg) before doing any plotting resulted in NewPage\n\tnever being called on the device, which in turn resulted in\n\tincorrect output for postcript() and pdf() devices.  (Reported\n\tby Marc Schwartz in discussion of the non-bug PR#7820.)\n\n    o\tterms.formula needed to add parentheses to formulae with\n\tterms containing '|'.  (PR#8462)\n\n    o\tpbirthday() and qbirthday() now also work for very improbable\n\tevents {those you are typically *not* interested in}.\n\n    o\tOnly source help files starting with an upper- or lower-case\n\tletter or digit and extension .Rd or .rd are documented to be\n\tprocessed.  This is more liberal in that starting with a digit\n\tis now also allowed, but rule is now enforced.\n\n    o\tnls(algorthm=&quot;port&quot;) was always taking positive numeric\n\tdifferences and so could exceed the upper bounds.\n\n    o\tmethods:::.asEnvironmentPackage() was not allowing for\n\tversioned installs.\n\n    o\t.find.package() now reports which package(s) it cannot find in\n\tthe case it stops with an error.\n\n    o\tThe standard Unix-alike version of file.show() gives an\n\tinformative message if it cannot open a file rather than the\n\t(possibly incorrect) 'NO FILE'.\n\n    o\twindow() did not allow non-overlapping ranges with\n\textend = TRUE.\t(PR#8545)\n\n    o\tpbinom(size = 0) now returns correct values (not NaN).\t(PR#8560)\n\n    o\t[dp]binom(x, *) for x &lt; 0 now always returns 0. (PR#8700)\n\tanalogous change in pgeom(), pnbinom() and ppois().\n\n    o\t[dqpr]geom and [dpqr]nbinom() now all consistently accept prob = 1\n\tbut not prob = 0.  qgeom(prob=1) now gives the correct values\n\t(not -1).\n\n    o\tINSTALL on Unix-alikes was not loading dependent packages when\n\tpreparing for lazy-loading.\n\n    o\tqcauchy(1) now gives +Inf instead of just a very large number.\n\n    o\tdf(0, f1, *) now properly returns Inf, 1, or 0 for f1 &lt; , = , or &gt; 2.\n\n    o\tqbinom(), qnbinom() and qpois() now use a better search and\n\tnormally reach the answer very quickly when it is large\n\t(instead of being slow or infinite-looping).\n\n    o\tpt(x, df) lost accuracy in the far tails (when |x| &gt; 1e154) for\n\tsmall df (like df = 0.001 for which such extremes are not unlikely).\n\n    o\tdbeta(x, a, b) underflowed internally and incorrectly gave 0\n\tfor very small x and a.\n\n    o\tNone of the warnings about convergence failures or loss of\n\tprecision in nmath (distribution and special functions) were\n\tbeing reported to the R user.\n\n    o\tdnt was missing from standalone nmath (under Unix-alikes).\n\n    o\tsplit() now accepts factors with numeric (but not storage mode\n\tinteger) codes.\n\n    o\tThe utilities such as 'check' now report active version numbers\n\tagain, as SVN 'last changed revision' numbers.\n\n    o\taddmargins() did not accept a name for 'FUN', only an expression.\n\n    o\t'+' for POSIXt objects now takes the tzone from whichever\n\tobject has it, so date+x is the same as x+date if x is numeric.\n\n    o\tmean.default() and var() compute means with an additional pass\n\tand so are often more accurate, e.g. the variance of a\n\tconstant vector is (almost) always zero and the mean of such a\n\tvector will be equal to the constant value to machine\n\tprecision.  (PR#1228)\n\n\tsum(), prod(), mean(), rowSums() and friends use a long double\n\taccumulator where available and so may be more accurate.  (This\n\tis particularly helpful on systems such as Sparc and AMD64\n\twhere long double gives considerably greater exponent range\n\tand precision than double.)\n\n    o\tread.dcf() now gives a warning on malformed lines.\n\n    o\tadd1.[g]lm now try harder to use the environment of the\n\tformula in the orginal fit to look for objects such as the\n\t'data' and 'subset' arguments.\n\n    o\tgaussian()$aic was inconsistent with e.g. the lm results from\n\tAIC() and extractAIC() for weighted fits: it treated the weights\n\tas case weights and not variance factors.\n\n    o\tsystem() on Unix-alikes ignored non-logical values of 'intern' and\n\ttreated 'intern = NA' as true.\n\n    o\tas.table() now produces non-NA rownames when converting a\n\tmatrix of more than 26 rows.  (PR#8652)\n\n    o\tPartial sorting used an algorithm that was intended only for a\n\tfew values of 'partial' and so could be far slower than a full\n\tsort.  It now switches to a barebones full sort for more than\n\t10 values of 'partial' and uses a more efficient recursive\n\timplementation for 2...10.\n\n    o\tsummary.glm() returned an estimate of dispersion of Inf for a\n\tgaussian glm with zero residual degrees of freedom and then\n\ttreated that as a known value.\tIt now uses the estimate NaN,\n\twhich is consistent with summary.lm().\n\n    o\tSys.sleep() on Unix-alikes was restricted to about 2147 seconds\n\tand otherwise might never have returned.  (PR#8678)\n\n    o\tis(obj, Cl) could wrongly report TRUE when Cl was a classUnion and\n\tmultiple inheritance was involved.\n\n    o\tconfint[.lm / .default] used label &quot;100 %&quot; for level = 0.999\n\n    o\tEmpty entries (i.e., extraneous &quot;,&quot;) in NAMESPACE files now give\n\ta better error message early at parsing time instead of a less\n\tcomprehensible one later at load time.\n\n    o\tall.equal(n1, n2) could erroneously return NA when n1, n2\n\tcontained large integers.\n\n    o\tanova.mlm() didn't handle multi-df effects properly in the\n\tsingle-model case (PR#8679)\n\n    o\tanova.mlm() had its colnames mangled by data.frame() (needed\n\tcheck.names=FALSE).\n\n    o\tsummary.glm() gave an NA estimate of dispersion for fits with\n\tzero weights.  (PR#8720)\n\n    o\tqhyper() had too small a tolerance for right-continuity on\n\tsome platforms so was not always an inverse to phyper().\n\n    o\trownames&lt;-.data.frame() and dimnames&lt;-.data.frame() tested the\n\tlength(s) of the replacement value(s) before coercion, which\n\tcan change the length (e.g. for class &quot;POSIXlt&quot;).\n\n    o\tmax() and min() ignored the largest/smallest representable\n\tinteger, as well as Inf/-Inf.  (PR#8731)\n\n    o\twrite.table() assumed factors had integer codes: it now allows\n\tmalformed factors with numeric codes (and otherwise throws an\n\terror).\n\n    o\tWorked around a Solaris restriction which meant that\n\tSys.sleep() was only effective for times of up to one second.\n\n    o   sink(, split=TRUE) now works correctly, but is allowed only on\n        platforms that support va_copy or __va_copy.  (PR#8716)\n\n    o\tfactanal(), prcomp() and princomp() now only check that columns\n\tin the model frame that will be used are numeric (they\n\tpreviously also checked columns which were part of negative terms\n\tin the formula).\n\n    o   Misuse of $ in apply could corrupt memory.  (PR#8718)\n\n    o\tapply() could fail if the function returned NULL (e.g. if\n\tthere was a single row).\n\n    o\tregisterS3method() failed due to a typo. (It was almost never\n\tused.)\n\n    o\tRegistering an S3 method for an S3 generic in another package\n\tthat was converted to an S4 generic in the same package as the\n\tS3 method, registered the method in the wrong place.\n\n    o\tRecall() used lookup for the function in use and so could fail\n\tif that was an S3 method not on the search path.\n\n    o\tRdconv -t Ssgm failed if it encountered \\link[opt]{arg}.\n\n    o\tuniroot() did not give a warning (as documented) if it failed\n\tto converge in 'maxiter' steps.  (PR#8751)\n\n    o\teapply (and as.list.environment) did not work for the base\n\tenvironment/namespace.  (PR#8761)\n\n    o\tAdded protection in configure against systems for which using\n\txmkmf fails to eport a C or C++ compiler.\n\n    o\texpand.grid() was constructing a data frame 'by hand' and so\n\tsetting integer row.names (which are documented to be\n\tcharacter).  It now sets character row names, and\n\trow.names.data.frame() coerces to character.\n\n    o\tqbeta() used == on volatile doubles for its convergence test,\n\twhich failed with gcc 3.3.x on ix86 Linux.  We now use a less\n\tfragile test (and lose a negligible amount of accuracy).\n\n    o\tls.str() was missing inherits=FALSE, and so could have\n\treported on an object of the same name but a different mode in\n\tthe enclosure of the given environment.\n\n    o\tlogLik.nls assumed that sigma^2 had been estimated, but did\n\tnot count this in the 'df' attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\t**************************************************\n\t*\t\t\t\t\t\t *\n\t*\t       2.2 SERIES NEWS\t\t\t *\n\t*\t\t\t\t\t\t *\n\t**************************************************\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.2.1 patched\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n\n    o\tThe macro SOCKLEN_T has been replaced by R_SOCKLEN_T to work\n\taround a problem with the headers of AIX 5.3.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tsub(fixed = TRUE) could get wrong the length of the character\n\tstring for elements of the result after the first.\n\n    o\tlegend() worked out which elements of 'lty' were valid before\n\tresizing 'lty', and so could fail if 'lty' was a different\n\tlength from 'legend'.\n\n    o\tstr(&lt;dendrogram&gt;) sometimes used much too many spaces (in 2.2.x).\n\n    o\teigen(eispack=TRUE) accessed areas off the matrix in some\n\tcircumstances (some asymmetric matrices with both complex\n\tconjugate pair and real eigenvalues).\n\n    o\tstrptime() in 2.2.1 sometimes did not set $isdst when it was\n\tpreviously set.\n\n    o\tAnother case of infinite influence has been worked around.\n\t(An addendum to PR#8367.)\n\n    o\tqr.coef() worked incorrectly with multiple rhs in the\n\tLAPACK-using cases.

(These are likely to affect\n\tthe answer only in MBCS locales such as UTF-8.)\n\n    o\tThe URW font metrics have been updated to versions from late\n\t2002 which cover more glyphs, including Cyrillic.\n\n    o\tNew postscript encodings for CP1250 (Windows East European),\n\tISO Latin-7 (8859-13, Latvian, Lithuanian and Maori), Cyrillic\n\t(8859-5), KOI8-R, KOI8-U and CP1251.\n\n    o\tconfigure has more support for the Intel and Portland Group\n\tcompilers on ix86 and x86_64 Linux.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL will clean up if interrupted (e.g. by ctrl-C from\n\tthe keyboard).\n\n    o\tThere is now a comprehensive French translation of the messages,\n\tthanks to Philippe Grosjean.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe undocumented use of atan() with two arguments is deprecated:\n\tinstead use atan2() (as documented).\n\n    o\tThe 'vfont' argument of axis() and mtext() is deprecated\n\t(it currently warns and does nothing).\n\n    o   The function mauchley.test() is deprecated (was a misspelling)\n\tand replaced by mauchly.test()\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tThe malloc's of AIX and OSF/1 which return NULL for size 0\n\tare now catered for in src/main/regex.c.\n\n    o\tNames of list elements which are missing are now printed as\n\t$&lt;NA&gt; and not $&quot;NA&quot; (which is how the non-missing name &quot;NA&quot; is\n\tprinted).  (Brought up in discussion of PR#8161.)\n\n    o\thelp.start() was not linking R.css for use by its front page and\n\timmediate links (2.2.0 only).\n\n    o\tIndexing by character NA matched the name &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o\tThe arith-true test used random inputs and did not set the seed, so\n\tit could fail very occasionally.\n\n    o\tarima() with 'fixed' supplied and p=0 for the non-seasonal\n\tpart could give spurious warnings about 'some AR parameters\n\twere fixed'.\n\n    o\tsummary.matrix() could give an infinite recursion on some\n\tclassed objects (e.g. those of class &quot;Surv&quot;).\n\n    o\tThe 255th character in an 8-bit character set was not handled\n\tcorrectly as a letter on some platforms where C char is\n\tsigned: for example it was printed as \\377 and not allowed in\n\tvariable names.  (Spotted by Alexey Shipunov in Russian\n\tencodings.)\n\n    o\tConversion from POSIXct to POSIXlt is done more accurately\n\taround the change of DST in years not supported by the OS\n\t(pre-1970 on Windows and some others, and in the far past or\n\tfuture).\n\n    o\tchisq.test(cbind(1:0, c(7,16)), simulate.p = TRUE) gave wrong\n\tP-values on some platforms. (PR#8224)\n\n    o\tpdf() was not writing details of the encoding to the file\n\tcorrectly.  (Spotted by Alexey Shipunov in Russian encodings.)\n\n    o\timage() was failing with an error when plotting a matrix\n\tof all NA values.  (PR#8228)\n\n\timage() could fail if called with add=FALSE (the default) and\n\tlength(x)=1 for either x or y, as it uses the plot coordinates of\n\tthe previous plot (if any).\n\n    o\ttools::checkMD5sums was not accepting file names with spaces in.\n\n    o\tThe plot() method for TukeyHSD() needed updating after adding\n\tadjusted p-values.  (PR#8229)\n\n    o\tread.fwf() did not work for header = TRUE.  (PR#8226)\n\n    o\tdiag() failed when its argument had NA values in its dimnames.\n\n    o\t[g]sub(pcre=TRUE) did not work correctly with \\U and \\L in a\n\tUTF-8 locale, even on the example on the help page.\n\n    o\tpromptMethods() was failing if the &quot;methods&quot; argument was supplied.\n\n    o\tis.loaded() now finds Fortran symbols whether or not the\n\tregistration mechanism has been used.\n\n    o\tISODateTime() mistakenly corrected non-existent times (when\n\tDST was being started) in the current time zone.\n\n    o\tSome replacement operations on data frames gave incorrect\n\tanswers, e.g. DF[3:4, &quot;y&quot;] if column &quot;y&quot; did not exist or was\n\ta matrix.\n\n    o\tgetGraphicsEvent() would cause memory corruption if passed an\n    \tempty prompt.\n\n    o\tqr() and chol() now pivot the colnames of the result when\n\tpivoting is used.  (PR#8258)\n\n    o\texample(points) omitted pch=0, although it was valid and\n\tsaid in the text to be illustrated.\n\n    o\tplot.default() had an unused 'lab' argument, thereby preventing\n\tthe 'lab' graphics parameter being passed through '...' .\n\n    o\tAlthough polygon(col = NA) was the stated default, specifying\n\tNA was not equivalent to omitting the argument (but col=NULL\n\twas equivalent).\n\n    o\tIm(-1) was pi. (PR#8272, a side effect from all previous\n\tversions of R returning the same value for Im and Arg of\n\tnon-complex numbers.)\n\n    o\tsymbols(fg) defaulted to colour 1, not par(&quot;col&quot;) as documented.\n\tIt does now defaults to par(&quot;col&quot;).\n\n    o\tpar(&quot;family&quot;) did not check the length of the value (up to 49\n\tbytes) and so could segfault.\n\n    o\taggregate.ts() did not allow for rounding in frequencies such\n\tas 1/5.\n\n    o\tprcomp(tol=) was not dropping the sdev's corresponding to\n\tdropped columns.\n\n    o\tSubassignment of a vector which increased the length of the\n\tvector _and_ had the wrong length of replacement could\n\toccasionally segfault.  (This has been there since at least\n\tmid 1997.)\n\n    o\tThe registration of .Fortran symbols was broken: these could\n\tonly be looked up if there were also .Call symbols registered!\n\n    o\tR CMD build was incorrectly rejecting the recommended form of\n\tname for a translation package, 'Translation-ll'.  (PR#8314)\n\n    o\tnumericDeriv() gave nonsense results unless the variables were\n\treal, which was not checked.\n\n    o\tpredict.prcomp() would sometimes give an error when predicting\n\ta single observation.  (PR#8324)\n\n    o\tmapply() could segfault if MoreArgs was not a list.  (PR#8332)\n\n    o\tThe arith-true test used identical() on floating-point results,\n\tand this allowed a failure when the relative difference was\n\tless than .Machine$double.eps but non-zero.\n\n    o\tqbinom() was not accepting p = -Inf when log.p = TRUE, although\n\tit is a legitimate value.\n\n    o\twrite.csv[2] only accepted logical constants for 'row.names', and\n\tnow accepts variables.\n\n    o\tConversion of .Rd files did not correctly match braces\n\tenclosing a whole argument, e.g. \\eqn{{\\bf a}}{a}.\n\n    o\tThe C function pythag (used if hypot was not available) would\n\tinfinite-loop on systems with effective optimizing compilers.\n\n    o\tWriting long formats (more than 1000 bytes) with connections\n\tthat use dummy_vfprintf could fail on some systems.  The limit\n\thas been changed to 100000 bytes pending a more complete fix in R\n\t2.3.0.\n\n    o\tMaking in src/nmath/standalone without making R was not\n\tmaking Rmath.h.\n\n    o\tBoth the R front-end and INSTALL could find the attempted\n\ttemporary directory name already in use on platforms without\n\tmktemp (and a genuine Bourne shell /bin/sh, not bash).  Now\n\tboth the process ID and a timestamp are used to create the\n\tdirectory name.\n\n    o\t[dpqr]gamma now return NaN for an invalid 'shape' parameter\n\t(rather than throw an error), for consistency with other\n\tdistribution functions.\n\n    o\tt() now longer drops dimnames 'list(NULL,NULL)' or 'list(NULL)'.\n\n    o\tInfluence measures such as rstandard() and cooks.distance()\n\tcould return infinite values rather than NaN for a case which\n\twas fitted exactly.  Similarly, plot.lm() could fail on such\n\texamples.  plot.lm(which = 5)  had to be modified to only plot\n\tcases with hat &lt; 1.  (PR#8367)\n\n\tlm.influence() was incorrectly reporting 'coefficients' and\n\t'sigma' as NaN for cases with hat = 1, and on some platforms\n\tnot detecting hat = 1 correctly.\n\n    o\tRmath.h for standalone Rmath was not recording HAVE_WORKING_LOG,\n        so R_log was not available on platforms defining it.\n\n    o\tHoltWinters() was using a slightly incorrect formula in the C code.\n\n    o\tdir.create() could be confused by a trailing slash on the\n\tpath, and by paths containing drives on Windows.\n\n    o\tThe search for tcl/tkConfig.sh looked in 'lib' before 'lib64'\n\tdirectories (and not at all in /usr/local/lib64) and so might\n \tprefer 32- to 64-bit versions if both are available.\n\n    o\tnlminb() used an uninitialized variable unless bounds were supplied,\n\tand so failed on 64-bit Solaris.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

The date shown is now the date of the last\n\tchange to the sources rather than the date the sources were\n\tprepared.\n\n    o\tis.null(expression()) now returns FALSE.  Only NULL gives TRUE\n\tin is.null().\n\n    o\tgraphics::xy.coords, xyz.coords and n2mfrow have been moved to\n\tthe grDevices name space (to be available for grid as well).\n\n\tgraphics::boxplot.stats, contourLines, nclass.*, and chull\n\thave been moved to the grDevices name space.  The C code\n\tunderlying chull() has been moved to package grDevices.\n\n    o\tsplit(x, f), split&lt;-() and unsplit() now by default split by all\n\tlevels of a factor f, even when some are empty.\n\tUse split(x, f, drop = TRUE) if you want the old behavior of\n\tdropping empty levels.\tsplit() and split&lt;-() are S3 generic\n\tfunctions with new arguments 'drop' and '...' and all methods now\n\tshould have 'drop' and '...' arguments as well.\n\n    o\tThe default for 'allowEscapes' in both read.table() and scan()\n\thas been changed to FALSE.\n\n    o\tThe default for 'gcFirst' in system.time() is now TRUE.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\t.Platform has a new component 'path.sep', the separator used\n\tbetween paths in environment variables such as PATH and TEXINPUTS.\n\n    o   anova.mlm() now handles the single-model case.\n\n    o\tHexadecimal values are now allowed for as.numeric() and\n\tas.integer() on all platforms, and as integer constants in R code.\n\n    o\tattach() now prints an information message when objects are\n\tmasked on the search path by or from a newly attached database.\n\n    o\taxis() now returns 'at' positions.\n\n    o   axis() has a new argument 'hadj' to control horizontal\n\tadjustment of labels.\n\n    o\taxis.Date() and axis.POSIXct() now accept a 'labels' argument\n\t(contributed by Gavin Simpson).\n\n    o\tbarplot() now has arguments 'log = &quot;&quot;' and 'add = FALSE'\n\t(as in barplot2() from package 'gplots').\n\n    o\tbaseenv() has been added, to return the base environment.  This\n    \tis currently still NULL, but will change in a future release.\n\n    o   boxplot() now responds to supplying 'yaxs' (via bxp()).\n\t(Wish of PR#8072.)\n\n    o\tcapabilities() has a new component 'NLS'.\n\n    o\tcbind() and rbind() now react to 'deparse.level' = {0,1,2}\n\t(as in another system not unlike R).\n\n    o\tExperimental versions of cbind() and rbind() in methods package,\n\tbased on new generic function cbind2(x,y) and rbind2().\t This will\n\tallow the equivalent of S4 methods for cbind() and rbind() ---\n\tcurrently only after an explicit activation call, see ?cbind2.\n\n    o\tNew functions cdplot() and spineplot() for conditional density\n        plots and spine plots or spinograms.  Spine plots are now used\n        instead of bar plots for x-y scatterplots where y is a factor.\n\n    o\tcheckDocFiles() in package 'tools' now checks for bad \\usage\n\tlines (syntactically invalid R code).\n\n    o   The nonparametric variants of cor.test() now behave better in\n\tthe presence of ties. The &quot;spearman&quot; method uses the asymptotic\n\tapproximation in that case, and the &quot;kendall&quot; method likewise,\n\tbut adds a correction for ties (this is not necessary in the\n\tSpearman case).\n\n    o\tThe X11 dataentry() now has support for X Input Methods\n\t(contributed by Ei-ji Nakama).\n\n    o\tdensity() is now an S3 generic where density.default() {former\n\tdensity()} has new argument 'weights' for specifying observation\n\tmasses different than the default 1/N -- based on a suggestion and\n\tcode from Adrian Baddeley.\n\n    o\tdownload.packages() now carries on if it encounters a download\n\terror (e.g. a repository with a corrupt index).\n\n    o\tdump() now skips missing objects with a warning rather than\n\tthrow an error.\n\n    o   Added &quot;POSIXlt&quot; methods for duplicated() and unique().\n\n    o\tFunction encoded_text_to_latex() in package tools translates\n\tLatin 1,2,9 and UTF-8 encoded character vectors to LaTeX\n\tescape sequences where appropriate.\n\n    o\tencodeString() allows justify = &quot;none&quot; for consistency with\n\tformat.default().  Some argument names have been lengthened\n\tfor clarity.\n\n    o\tfile(), fifo() and pipe() now (if possible) report a reason\n        if they fail to open a connection.\n\n    o\tformat.default() now has a 'width' argument, and 'justify' can\n\tnow centre character strings.\n\n\tformat.default() has new arguments 'na.encode' to control\n\twhether NA character strings are encoded (true by default),\n\tand 'scientific' to control the use of fixed/scientific\n\tnotation for real/complex numbers.\n\n\tHow format() works on a list is now documented, and uses\n\targuments consistently with their usage on an atomic vector.\n\n    o\tformat.info() now has a 'digits' argument, and is documented\n\tto work for all atomic vectors (it used to work for all but\n\traw vectors.).\n\n    o\tNew function glob2rx() for translating `wildcard' aka `globbing'\n\tto regular expressions.\n\n    o\tThere is a new function gregexpr() which generalizes regexpr()\n        to search for all matches in each of the input strings (not\n        just the first match).\n\n    o\t[g]sub() now have a 'useBytes' argument like grep() and regexpr().\n\n    o\t[g]sub(perl = TRUE) support \\L and \\U in the replacement.\n\n    o   iconv() has been moved from 'utils' to 'base'.\n\n    o\tidentify()'s default method has additional arguments 'atpen'\n\tand 'tolerance' (following S).\n\n    o\tKalmanForecast() and KalmanLike() now have an optional argument\n\tfast=FALSE to prevent their arguments being modified.\n\n    o\tExact p-values are available in ks.test() for the one-sided and\n\ttwo-sided one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.\n\n    o\tlabels() now has a method for &quot;dist&quot; objects (replacing that\n\tfor names() which was withdrawn in 2.1.0).\n\n    o\tlibrary() now explicitly checks for the existence of\n\tdirectories in 'lib.loc': this avoids some warning messages.\n\n    o\tloadNamespace(keep.source=) now applies only to that namespace\n\tand not others it might load to satisfy imports: this is now\n\tconsistent with library().\n\n    o\tmatch.arg() has a new argument 'several.ok = FALSE'.\n\n    o\tmax.col() has a new argument for non-random behavior in the\n\tcase of ties.\n\n    o   memory.profile() now uses the type names returned by typeof()\n\tand no longer has two unlabelled entries.\n\n    o\tmethods() now warns if it appears to have been called on a\n\tnon-generic function.\n\n    o\tThe default mosaicplot() method by default draws grey boxes.\n\n    o\tnlminb(), similar to that in S-PLUS, added to package 'stats'.\n\n    o\tNew algorithm &quot;port&quot; (the nl2sol algorithm available in the\n\tPort library on netlib) added to the nls() function in the\n\t'stats' package.\n\n    o\tobject.size() now supports more types, including external\n\tpointers and weak references.\n\n    o\toptions() now returns its result in alphabetical order, and is\n\tdocumented more comprehensively and accurately.  (Now all\n\toptions used in base R are documented, including\n\tplatform-specific ones.)\n\n\tSome options are now set in the package which makes use of\n\tthem (grDevices, stats or utils) if not already set when the\n\tpackage is loaded.\n\n    o\tNew option(&quot;OutDec&quot;) to set the decimal point for output conversions.\n\n    o\tNew option(&quot;add.smooth&quot;) to add smoothers to a plot, currently\n\tonly used by plot.lm().\n\n    o\tpie() has new optional arguments 'clockwise' and 'init.angle'.\n\n    o\tplot.lm() has two new plots (for 'which' = 5 or 6), plotting\n\tresiduals or cook distances versus (transformed) leverages - unless\n\tthese are constant.  Further, the new argument 'add.smooth' adds a\n\tloess smoother to the point plots by default, and 'qqline = TRUE'\n\tadds a qqline() to the normal plot.\n\tThe default for 'sub.caption' has been improved for long calls.\n\n    o\tR.home() has been expanded to return the paths to components\n\t(which can as from this version be installed elsewhere).\n\n    o   readbin() and writeBin() now support raw vectors as well as\n\tfilenames and connections.\n\n    o\tread.dcf() can now read gzipped files.\n\n    o\tread.table() now passes 'allowEscapes' to scan().\n\n    o\tsample(x, size, prob, replace = TRUE) now uses a faster\n\talgorithm if there are many reasonably probable values.  (This\n\tdoes mean the results will be different from earlier versions\n\tof R.)  The speedup is modest unless 'x' is very large _and_\n\t'prob' is very diffuse so that thousands of distinct values\n\twill be generated with an appreciable frequency.\n\n    o\tscatter.smooth() now works a bit more like other plotting\n\tfunctions (e.g., accepts a data frame for argument 'x').\n\tImprovements suggested by Kevin Wright.\n\n    o\tsignif() on complex numbers now rounds jointly to give the\n\trequested number of digits in the larger component, not\n\tindependently for each component.\n\n    o\tNew generic function simulate() in the 'stats' package with\n\tmethods for some classes of fitted models.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline() has a new argument 'keep.data' which allows to\n\tprovide residuals() and fitted() methods for smoothing splines.\n\n    o\tAttempting source(file, chdir=TRUE) with a URL or connection\n\tfor 'file' now gives a warning and ignores 'chdir'.\n\n    o\tsource() closes its input file after parsing it rather than\n\tafter executing the commands, as used to happen prior to\n\t2.1.0.  (This is probably only significant on Windows where\n\tthe file is locked for a much shorter time.)\n\n    o\tsplit(), split&lt;-(), unsplit() now have a new argument 'drop = FALSE',\n\tby default not dropping empty levels; this is *not* back compatible.\n\n    o\tsprintf() now supports asterisk `*' width or precision\n\tspecification (but not both) as well as `*1$' to `*99$'.  Also the\n\thandling of `%' as conversion specification terminator is now\n\tleft to the system and doesn't affect following specifications.\n\n    o\tThe plot method for stl() now allows the colour of the range\n\tbars to be set (default unchanged at &quot;light gray&quot;).\n\n    o\tAdded tclServiceMode() function to the tcltk package to allow\n\tupdating to be suspended.\n\n    o\tterms.formula() no longer allows '.' in a formula unless there\n\tis a (non-empty) 'data' argument or 'allowDotAsName = TRUE' is\n\tsupplied.  We have found several cases where 'data' had not\n\tbeen passed down to terms() and so '.' was interpreted as a\n\tsingle variable leading to incorrect results.\n\n    o\tNew functions trans3d(), the 3D -&gt; 2D utility from persp()'s\n\texample, and extendrange(), both in package 'grDevices'.\n\n    o\tTukeyHSD() now returns p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons\n\t(based on a patch contributed by Fernando Henrique Ferraz P. da Rosa).\n\n    o\tNew functions URLencode() and URLdecode(), particularly for use\n\twith file:// URLs.  These are used by e.g. browse.env(),\n\tdownload.file(), download.packages() and various help() print\n\tmethods.\n\n    o\tFunctions utf8ToInt() and intToUtf8() to work with UTF-8\n\tencoded character strings (irrespective of locale or OS-level\n\tUTF-8 support).\n\n    o\t[dqp]wilcox and wilcox.test work better with one very large sample\n\tsize and an extreme first argument.\n\n    o\twrite() has a new argument 'sep'.\n\n    o\twrite.csv[2] now also support row.names = FALSE.\n\n\n\n    o\tThe specification of the substitutions done when processing\n\tRenviron files is more liberal: see ?Startup.  It now\n\taccepts forms like R_LIBS=${HOME}/Rlibrary:${WORKGRP}/R/lib .\n\n    o\tAdded recommendation that packages have an overview man page\n\t&lt;pkg&gt;-package.Rd, and the promptPackage() function to create a\n\tskeleton version.\n\n    o\tReplacement indexing of a data frame by a logical matrix index\n\tcontaining NAs is allowed in a few more cases, in particular\n\talways when the replacement value has length one.\n\n    o\tConversion of .Rd files to latex now handles encoding more\n\tcomprehensively, including some support for UTF-8.\n\n    o\tThe internal regex code has been upgraded to glibc-2.3.5.\n\tApart from a number of bug fixes, this should be somewhat\n\tfaster, especially in UTF-8 locales.\n\n    o\tPCRE has been updated to version 6.2.\n\n    o\tzlib has been updated to version 1.2.3.\n\n    o\tbzip2 has been updated to version 1.0.3.\n\n    o\tComplex arithmetic is now done by C99 complex types where\n\tsupported.  This is likely to boost performance, but is\n\tsubject to the accuracy with which it has been implemented.\n\n    o\tThe printing of complex numbers has changed, handling numbers\n\tas a whole rather than in two parts.  So both real and\n\timaginary parts are shown to the same accuracy, with the\n\t'digits' parameter referring to the accuracy of the larger\n\tcomponent, and both components are shown in fixed or\n\tscientific notation (unless one is entirely zero when it is\n\talways shown in fixed notation).\n\n    o\tError messages from .C() and .Fortran(), and from parsing errors,\n\tare now more informative.\n\n    o\tThe date and date-time functions work better with dates more\n\tthan 5000 years away from 1970-01-01 (by making dubious\n\tassumptions about the calendar in use).\n\n    o\tThere is now a traditional Chinese translation, and a much more\n\textensive Russian translation.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tCapability &quot;IEEE754&quot; is defunct.\n\n    o\tloadURL() is defunct: use load(url()).\n\n    o\tdelay() is defunct: use delayedAssign() instead.\n\n    o\tThe 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),\n\tnew.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is\n\tdefunct in favour of 'repos'.\n\n    o\twrite.table0() is deprecated in favour of the much faster\n\twrite.table().\n\n    o\tformat.char() is deprecated in favour of format.default().\n\n    o\tR_HOME/etc/Rprofile is no longer looked for if\n\tR_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site does not exist.  (This has been\n\tundocumented since R 1.4.0.)\n\n    o\tCRAN.packages() is deprecated in favour of available.packages().\n\n    o\tRd.sty no longer processes pre-2.0.0 conversions containing \\Link.\n\n    o\tThe stubs for the defunct device GNOME/gnome have been removed.\n\n    o\tprint.matrix() (which has been identical to print.default since\n\tR 1.7.0) has been removed.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n    o\tLDFLAGS now defaults to -L/usr/local/lib64 on most Linux\n\t64-bit OSes (but not ia64).  The use of lib/lib64 can be\n\toverridden by the new variable LIBnn.\n\n    o\tThe default installation directory is now ${prefix}/${LIBnn}/R,\n\t/usr/local/lib64/R on most 64-bit Linux OSes and /usr/local/lib/R\n\telsewhere.\n\n    o\tThe places where the doc, include and share directory trees are\n\tinstalled can be specified independently: see the R-admin manual.\n\n    o\tWe now test for wctrans_t, as apparently some broken OSes have\n\twctrans but not wctrans_t (which is required by the relevant\n\tstandards) .\n\n    o\tAny external BLAS found is now tested to see if the complex\n\troutine zdotu works correctly: this provides a compatibility\n\ttest of compiler return conventions.\n\n    o\tInstallation without NLS is now cleaner, and does not install\n\tany message catalogues.\n\n    o\tsrc/modules/lapack/dlamc.f is now compiled with -ffloat-store\n\tif f2c/gcc are used, as well as if g77 is used.\n\n    o\tAll the Fortran code has been checked to be fully F77\n\tcompliant so there are no longer any warnings from F95\n\tcompilers such as gfortran.\n\n    o\tThe (not-recommended) options --with-system-zlib,\n\t--with-system-bzlib and -with-system-pcre now have 'system' in\n\tthe name.\n\n    o\tIf a Java runtime environment is detected at configure time\n\tits library path is appended to LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent.\n\tNew Java-related variables JAVA_HOME (path to JRE/JDK), JAVA_PROG\n\t(path to Java interpreter), JAVA_LD_PATH (Java library path)\n\tand JAVA_LIBS (flags to link against JNI) are made available\n\tin Makeconf.\n\n    o\tEi-ji Nakama was contributed a patch for FPU control with the\n\tIntel compilers on ix86 Linux.\n\n\nMAC OS X INSTALLATION\n\n    o\t--with-blas=&quot;-framework vecLib&quot; --with-lapack and\n\t--with-aqua are now the default configure options.\n\n    o\tThe default framework version name was changed to not contain\n\tthe patch level (i.e. it is now 2.2 instead of 2.2.0).  Also\n\tit can be overridden at configure time by setting FW_VERSION\n\tto the desired name.\n\n    o\tThe Rmath stand-alone library is now correctly installed inside\n\tthe R.framework if R was configured as a framework.  In\n\taddition, make install-Rmath-framework will install a\n\tstand-alone Rmath framework in /Library/Frameworks (unless\n\toverridden by RMATH_FRAMEWORK_DIR specifying full framework\n\tpath and name including the .framework extension).\n\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION\n\n    o\tThe encoding for a packages' 00Index.html is chosen from the\n\tEncoding: field (if any) of the DESCRIPTION file and from the\n\t\\encoding{} fields of any Rd files with non-ASCII titles.\n\tIf there are conflicts, first-found wins with a warning.\n\n    o\tR_HOME/doc/html/packages.html is now remade by R not Perl code.\n\tThis may result in small changes in layout and a change in\n\tencoding (to UTF-8 where supported).\n\n    o\tThe return value of new.packages() is now updated for any\n\tpackages which may be installed.\n\n    o\tavailable.packages() will read a compressed PACKAGES.gz file in\n\tpreference to PACKAGES if available on the repository: this\n\twill reduce considerably the download time on a dialup connection.\n\n\tThe downloaded information about a repository is cached for the\n\tcurrent R session.\n\n    o\tThe information about library trees found by\n\tinstalled.packages() is cached for the current session, and\n\tupdated only if the modification date of the top-level\n\tdirectory has been changed.\n\n    o\tA data index is now installed for a package with a 'data' dir\n\tbut no 'man' dir (even though it will have undocumented data objects).\n\n    o\tcontrib.url path for type=&quot;mac.binary&quot; has changed from\n\tbin/macosx/&lt;version&gt; to\tbin/macosx/&lt;arch&gt;/contrib/&lt;version&gt;\n\twhere &lt;arch&gt; corresponds to R.version$arch\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tcheckFF() used by R CMD check has since R 2.0.0 not reported\n\tmissing PACKAGE arguments when testing installed packages with\n\tnamespaces.  It now\n\n\t- treats installed and source packages in the same way.\n\n\t- reports missing arguments unless they are in a function in\n\t  the namespace with a useDynLib declaration (as the\n\t  appropriate DLL for such calls can be searched for).\n\n    o\tRd2dvi sets the encoding(s) used appropriately.\t If UTF-8\n\tencoding is used, latex &gt;= 2003/12/01 is required.\n\n    o\tcodoc() allows help files named pkg_name-defunct.Rd to have\n\tundocumented arguments (and not just base-defunct.Rd).\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tC function massdist() {called from density()} has new argument\n\t'xmass' (= weights).\n\n    o\tRaw vectors passed to .C() are now passed as unsigned char *\n\trather than as SEXPs.  (Wish of Keith Frost, PR#7853)\n\n    o\tThe search for symbols in a .C/.Call/... call without a\n\tpackage argument now searches for an enclosing namespace and\n\tso finds functions defined within functions in a namespace.\n\n    o\tR_max_col() has new (5th) argument '*ties_meth' allowing\n\tnon-random behavior in the case of ties.\n\n    o\tThe header files have been rationalized: the BLAS routine\n\tLSAME is now declared in BLAS.h not Linpack.h, Applic.h no\n\tlonger duplicates routines from Linpack.h, and Applic.h is\n\tdivided into API and non-API sections.\n\n    o   memory.c has been instrumented so that Valgrind can track R's\n        internal memory management.  To use this, configure using\n               --with-valgrind-instrumentation=level\n        where level is 1 or 2.  Both levels will find more bugs with\n        gctorture(TRUE).  Level 2 makes Valgrind run extremely slowly.\n\n    o\tSome support for raw vectors has been added to Rdefines.h.\n\n    o\tR_BaseEnv has been added, to refer to the base environment.\n    \tThis is currently equal to R_NilValue, but it will change in\n    \ta future release.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\t%/% has been adjusted to make x == (x %% y) + y * ( x %/% y )\n\tmore likely in cases when extended-precision registers were\n\tinterfering.\n\n    o\tOperations on POSIXct objects (such as seq(), max() and\n\tsubsetting) try harder to preserve time zones and warn if\n\tinconsistent time zones are used.\n\n    o\tas.function.default() no longer asks for a bug report when\n\tgiven an invalid body. (PR#1880, PR#7535, PR#7702)\n\n    o\tHershey fonts and grid output (and therefore lattice output)\n\tnow rescale correctly in fit-to-window resizing on a Windows\n\tgraphics device.  Line widths also scale now.\n\n    o\tPlotmath has more support for multibyte characters (contributed\n\tby Ei-ji Nakama).\n\n    o\tThe X11() device now hints the window manager so that decorations\n\tappear reliably under e.g. the GNOME WM\t (contributed\n\tby Ei-ji Nakama).\n\n    o\tSubsetting a matrix or an array as a vector used to attempt to\n\tuse the row names to name the result, even though the\n\tarray might be longer than the row names.  Now this is only\n\tdone for 1D arrays when it is done in all cases, even matrix\n\tindexing.  (Tidies up after the fix to PR#937.)\n\n    o\tConstants in mathlib are declared 'const static double' to\n\tavoid performance issues with the Intel Itanium compiler.\n\n    o\tThe parser checks the format of numeric constants more\n\tthoroughly so for example '123E-' is no longer valid.\n\n    o\tcontourLines() no longer requires an open device (used to\n\tstart a device unnecessarily).\tFix suggested by Barry Rowlingson.\n\n    o\tcapabilities() used partial matching but was not documented\n\tto: it no longer does so.\n\n    o\tkernel(1,0) printed wrongly;  kernel(&lt;name-string&gt;, *) now returns\n\ta named kernel in all cases; plot(kernel(.),..) is more flexible.\n\n    o\tqgamma(1,s) didn't give +Inf for some s.\n\n    o\tinstalled.packages() and download.packages() now always\n\treturn a matrix as documented, possibly with 0 rows (rather than\n\ta 0-length character vector or NULL).\n\n    o\tArithmetic operations on data frames no longer coerce the\n\tnames to syntatically valid names.\n\n    o\tUnits are now properly recycled in grid layouts\n\twhen 'widths' or 'heights' are shorter than the number of\n\tcolumns or rows (PR#8014).\n\n    o\tDF &lt;- data.frame(A=1:2, B=3:4); DF[1, 1:3] &lt;- NULL gave a wrong\n\terror message.\n\n    o\tspline()/spinefun()'s C code had a memory access buglet which\n\tnever lead to incorrect results.  (PR#8030)\n\n    o\tsum() was promoting logical arguments to double not integer\n\t(as min() and other members of its group do).\n\n    o   loess() had a bug causing it to occasionally miscalculate\n        standard errors (PR#7956).  Reported by Benjamin Tyner, fixed\n        by Berwin Turlach.\n\n    o\tlibrary(keep.source=) was ignored if the package had a\n\tnamespace (the setting of options(&quot;keep.source.pkgs&quot;) was\n\talways used).\n\n    o\thist.POSIXct() and hist.Date() now respect par(&quot;xaxt&quot;).\n\n    o\tThe 'vfont' argument was not supported correctly in title(),\n\tmtext(), and axis().  The 'vfont' argument is superseded by\n\tthe par(family=) approach introduced in 2.0.0.  This bug-fix\n\tjust updates the warning messages and documentation to\n\tproperly reflect the new order of things.\n\n    o\tThe C-level function PrintGenericVector could overflow if\n\tasked to print a length-1 character vector of several thousand\n\tcharacters.  This could happen when printing a list matrix,\n\tand was fatal up to 2.1.1 and silently truncated in 2.1.1 patched.\n\n    o\tWhat happened for proc.time() and system.time() on\n\t(Unix-alike) systems which do not support timing was\n\tincorrectly documented.  (They both exist but throw an error.)\n\tFurther, systen.time() would give an error in its on.exit\n\texpression.\n\n    o\tweighted.residuals() now does sensible things for glm() fits:\n\tin particular it now agrees with an lm() fit for a Gaussian glm()\n\tfit.  (PR#7961).\n\n    o   The 'lm' and 'glm' methods for add1() took the weights and\n\toffset from the original fit, and so gave errors in the\n\t(dubious) usage where the upper scope resulted in a smaller\n\tnumber of cases to fit (e.g. by omitting missing values in new\n\tvariables).  (PR#8049)\n\n    o\tdemo() had a 'device' argument that did nothing (although it\n\twas documented to): it has been removed.\n\n    o\tSetting new levels on a factor dropped all existing\n\tattributes, including class &quot;ordered&quot;.\n\n    o\tformat.default(justify=&quot;none&quot;) now by default converts NA\n\tcharacter strings, as the other values always did.\n\n    o\tformat.info() often gave a different field width from format()\n\tfor character vectors (e.g. including missing values or\n\tnon-printable characters).\n\n    o\taxis() now ensures that if 'labels' are supplied as character\n\tstrings or expressions then 'at' is also supplied (since the\n\tcalculated value for 'at' can change under resizing).\n\n    o\tDefining S4 methods for &quot;[&quot; had resulted in changed behavior of S3\n\tdispatch in a very rare case which no longer happens.\n\n    o\tFixed segfault when PostScript font loading fails, e.g., when\n\tR is unable to find afm files (reported by Ivo Welch).\n\n    o\tR CMD BATCH &lt;file&gt; now also works when &lt;file&gt; does not end in a\n\tnewline on Unix-alike platforms.\n\n    o   terms.formula() got confused if the 'data' argument was a list with\n\tnon-syntactic names.\n\n    o\tprompt() and hence package.skeleton() now produce *.Rd files that\n\tgive no errors (but warnings) when not edited, much more often.\n\n    o\tpromptClass() and promptMethods() now also escape &quot;%&quot; e.g. in '%*%'\n\tand the latter gives a message about the file written.\n\n    o\twilcox.test() now warns when conf.level is set higher than\n\tachievable, preventing errors (PR#3666) and incorrect answers\n\twith extremely small sample sizes.\n\n    o\tThe default (protection pointer) stack size (the default for\n\t'--max-ppsize') has been increased from 10000 to 50000 in order to\n\tmatch the increased default options(&quot;expressions&quot;) (in R 2.1.0).\n\n    o\tThe R front-end was expecting --gui=tk not Tk as documented,\n\tand rejecting --gui=X11.\n\n    o\tRdconv -t latex protected only the first &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; in a chunk\n\tagainst conversion to guillemets.\n\n    o\tcallNextMethod() and callGeneric() have fixes related to\n\thandling arguments.\n\n    o\tls.diag() now works for fits with missing data.

The example also lost the labels.\n\n    o\tR CMD check assumed 'tar' was GNU tar and so supported -z.\n\n    o\tread.table() was not handing escaped quotes inside quoted fields\n\tin the first five lines of the file.  (PR#7789)\n\n\tIt was also not handling correctly EOF in the first five lines\n\twhen reading from stdin().  (PR#7772)\n\n    o\t'make uninstall' was incomplete.\n\n    o\tmake.packages.html() called by help.start() was failing if\n\tthere were installed packages with help titles invalid in the\n\tcurrent locale.\n\n    o\tprintCoefmat(signif.legend = FALSE) was non-functional. (PR#7802)\n\n    o\tSome as.date.frame() methods failed because the expression\n\tdeparsed into multiple lines. (PR#7808)\n\n    o\tsetRepositories() had a typo. (PR#7810)\n\n    o\tPrinting arrays/data frames with multibyte characters in the\n\tcolumn labels was sometimes misaligned or using excessive space.\n\t(PR#7803)\n\n    o\tThe Tcl/Tk console did not support multibyte characters.\n\n    o\tas.POSIXlt() could give infinite recursion if passed a corrupt\n\t&quot;POSIXct&quot; object (generated by an incorrect call to c.POSIXct,\n\tPR#7826).\n\n    o\tupdate.packages() was not passing 'type' correctly to\n\tinstall.packages().\n\n    o\tPrinting the result of an unbalanced model.tables() call\n\tsometimes got confused if terms() had rearranged interaction\n\tterms.\t(PR#7829)\n\n    o\t.Platform$pkgType was wrong on the CRAN MacOS X build, and\n\t.install.macbinary() was missing.\n\n    o\tas.personList() as used by citation() got confused by names\n\tcontaining &quot;and&quot;.  (PR#7797)\n\n    o\tSubscripting an array by a matrix containing zero or negative\n\tvalues or the wrong number of columns was not handled\n\tconsistently. (PR#7824)\n\n    o\tselect.list(multiple=TRUE) now detects and tries again for invalid\n\ttext input.\n\n    o\tadd1.[g]lm could give strange results with interaction terms\n\twhen the model and the upper scope had different orders for\n\tthe main effects.  (PR#7842)\n\n    o\tA bug had sneaked into the anova.mlmlist() code, affecting the\n\tGreenhouse-Geisser epsilon. Code wrongly assumed a matrix to\n\tbe symmetric. (Thanks to Bela Bauer.)\n\n    o\tanova.mlmlist() and mauchley.test() are now more tolerant to rank\n\tdeficiency in the M and X matrices (also when they are implicitly\n\tgenerated via model.matrix()).\n\n    o   anova.mlm had a scoping issue (PR#7898)\n\n    o\tpf() with infinite df is allowed again.\t It is now more accurate\n\tfor extreme ratios of dfs, especially when there is a\n\tnon-centrality parameter.\n\n    o\tdf() was inaccurate for large df (1e16 or greater).\n\n    o\tdt() was inaccurate for large df (1e9 or greater) with a\n\tnon-centrality parameter.\n\n    o\trunmed(*, algorithm=&quot;Turlach&quot;) seg.faulted in rare cases.\n\n    o\tstrwrap() now makes a reasonable job of text that is invalid in the\n\tcurrent locale.\n\n    o\tReading with encoding &quot;UCS-2LE&quot; will remove any Byte Order\n\tMark, as most implementations of iconv fail to handle BOMs\n\t(which are present in 'Windows Unicode' files).\n\n    o\tunique() for a list was incorrectly reporting `unimplemented'.\n\n    o\tThe parser's contextstack was not protected against overflow,\n\te.g. more than 50 unmatched '('.  (PR#7859)\n\n    o\tsource(file, chdir = TRUE) was not checking that 'file' was a\n\tfilepath (rather than a URL).  For 2.1.0 only, it did not work\n\teven if 'file' was a filepath.\n\n    o\tHershey fonts were being sized based on pixels not points so came\n        out too small on devices where pixels were noticeably different\n\tfrom points (e.g., win.printer() and high-resolution screens).\n\n\tFix means that default size of Hershey fonts may be slightly\n\tdifferent, for example, smaller by default on PostScript and PDF.\n\n    o\tThe branch cuts in the complex versions of the inverse\n\ttrigonometric and hyperbolic functions were non-standard.\n\t(PR#7871)\n\n    o\ttruncate() on file() connections was limited to files &lt; 2Gb.  It\n\tnow works for larger files at least on 64-bit OSes and others\n\twhere ftruncate supports such files.  (Related to PR#7879)\n\n    o\tproj.aovlist() did not work correctly on objects fitted from a\n\tdata frame with row names.\n\n    o\tThe coding standards recommendations had\n\tnuke-trailing-whitespace where newer versions of ESS need\n\tess-nuke-trailing-whitespace.  (PR#7888)\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() missed the first newline in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o\tpbirthday() reported p = 1 too often when coincident &gt; 2.\n\n    o\tplot(1:3, exp(1:3), log = &quot;y&quot;, ylim = c(30,1)) {reversed\n\tlog-scale axis} now works, based on Uwe Ligges' suggestions.\n\t(PR#7894)\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() was aborting when a package in a bundle was\n\tchosen from a menu.  It failed if more than one package in a\n\tbundle was chosen from the command line.\n\n    o\tqcauchy() suffered from underflow in the extreme tails.  (PR#7902)\n\n    o\tPrinting of raw matrices/arrays was not implemented. (PR#7912)\n\n    o\tgetCallingDLL()'s default first argument did not correspond to\n\tits description and has been changed.  The mismatch caused\n\tsymbols in .C/.Call/.Fortran calls without a PACKAGE= argument \n\tto be potentially looked up in the wrong namespace.\n\n    o\tBinary save() of raw vectors was not working correctly on\n\tbig-endian platforms.  (PR#7812)\n\n    o   as.Date.factor() now accepts a format argument.\n\n    o\tWorkaround added for FreeBSD which does not have alloca.h _and_\n\tdoes not allow alloca() to be declared.\n\n    o\tidentify() now respects 'cex'.  (PR#660)\n\n\tWarnings from identify() are now printed immediately even on\n\tconsoles with delayed printing.\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             &#216;ster Farimagsgade 5, Entr.B\n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     PO Box 2099, 1014 Cph.

This means e.g. any(list()) works.\n\n    o\tNew functions for multivariate linear models: anova.mlm(),\n\tSSD(), estVar(), mauchley.test() (for sphericity).\n\n\tvcov() now does something more sensible for &quot;mlm&quot; class objects.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame.table() has a new argument 'responseName'\n\t(contributed by Bill Venables).\n\n    o\tas.dist() and cophenetic() are now generic, and the latter has a\n\tnew method for objects of class &quot;dendrogram&quot;.\n\n    o\tas.ts() is now generic.\n\n    o\tbinomial() has a new &quot;cauchit&quot; link (suggested by Roger Koenker).\n\n    o\tchisq.test() has a new argument 'rescale.p'.  It is now possible\n\tto simulate (slowly) the P value also in the 1D case\n\t(contributed by Rolf Turner).\n\n    o\tchoose(n,k) and lchoose(.) now also work for arbitrary (real) n\n\tin accordance with the general binomial theorem.  choose(*,k)\n\tis more accurate (and faster) for small k.\n\n    o\tAdded colorRamp() and colorRampPalette() functions for color\n\tinterpolation.\n\n    o\tcolSums()/rowSums() now allow arrays with a zero-length extent\n\t(requested by PR#7775).\n\n    o\tconfint() has stub methods for classes &quot;glm&quot; and &quot;nls&quot; that\n\tinvoke those in package MASS.  This avoids using the &quot;lm&quot;\n\tmethod for &quot;glm&quot; objects if MASS is not attached.\n\n\tconfint() has a default method using asymptotic normality.\n\n    o\tcontr.SAS() has been moved from the 'nlme' package to the\n\t'stats' package.\n\n    o\tNew function convertColors() maps between color spaces.\n\tcolorRamp() uses it.\n\n    o\tThe cov() function in the non-Pearson cases now ranks data after\n\tremoval of missing values, not before.\tThe pairwise-complete\n\tmethod should now be consistent with cor.test.\t(Code\n\tcontributed by Shigenobu Aoki.)\n\n    o\tAdded delayedAssign() function to replace delay(), which is now\n\tdeprecated.\n\n    o\tdir.create() has a new argument 'recursive' serving the same\n\tpurpose as Unix's mkdir -p.\n\n    o\tdo.call() now takes either a function or a character string as\n\tits first argument.  The supplied arguments can optionally be\n\tquoted.\n\n    o\tduplicated() and unique() now accept &quot;list&quot; objects, but are\n\tfast only for simple list objects.\n\n    o\tecdf() now has jumps of the correct size (a multiple of 1/n)\n\tif there are ties.  (Wished by PR#7292).\n\n    o\teff.aovlist() assumed orthogonal contrasts for any term\n\twith more than one degree of freedom: this is now documented\n\tand checked for.  Where each term only occurs in only one\n\tstratum the efficiencies are all one: this is detected and\n\torthogonal contrasts are not required.\n\n    o\tNew function encodeString() to encode character strings in the\n\tsame way that printing does.\n\n    o\tfile(&quot;clipboard&quot;) now work for reading the primary selection on\n\tUnix-alikes with an active X11 display.\t (It has long worked\n\tfor reading and writing under Windows.)\t The secondary\n\tselection can also be read: see ?file.\n\n\tfile() now allows mode &quot;w+b&quot; as well as &quot;w+&quot;.\n\n    o\tfile.append() has been tuned, including for the case of\n\tappending many files to a single file.\n\n    o\tFunctions flush.console() and select.list() are now available\n\ton all platforms.  There is a Tcl/Tk-based version of\n\tselect.list() called tk_select.list() in package tcltk.\n\n    o\tgc() now reports maximum as well as current memory use.\n\n    o\tA new function getGraphicsEvent() has been added which will allow\n\tmouse or keyboard input from a graphics device. (NB: currently\n\tonly the Windows screen device supports this function.\tThis\n\tshould improve before the 2.1.0 release.)\n\n    o\tNew functions gray.colors()/grey.colors() for gray color\n\tpalettes.\n\n    o\tgrep(), gsub(), sub() and regexpr() now always attempt to\n\tcoerce their 'pattern', 'x', 'replacement' and 'text'\n\targuments to character.\t Previously this was undocumented but\n\tdone by [g]sub() and regexpr() for some values of their\n\tother arguments.  (Wish of PR#7742.)\n\n    o\tgsub/sub() have a new 'fixed' method.\n\n    o\tNew function hcl() for creating colors for a given hue,\n\tchroma and luminance (i.e. perceptual hsv).\n\n    o\tisTRUE() convenience function to be used for programming.\n\n    o\tkmeans() now returns an object of class &quot;kmeans&quot; which has a\n\tprint() method.\n\n\tTwo alternative algorithms have been implemented.\n\n\tIf the number of centres is supplied, it has a new option of\n\tmultiple random starts.\n\n    o\tThe limits on the grid size in layout() are now documented, and\n\thave been raised somewhat by using more efficient internal\n\tstructures.\n\n    o\tlegend() now accepts positioning by keyword, e.g. &quot;topleft&quot;,\n\tand can put a title within the legend.\t(Suggested by Elizabeth\n\tPurdom in PR#7400.)\n\n    o\tmahalanobis() now has a '...' argument which is passed to solve()\n\tfor computing the inverse of the covariance matrix, this replaces\n\tthe former 'tol.inv' argument.\n\n    o\tmenu() uses a multi-column layout if possible for more than\n\t10 choices.\n\n\tmenu(graphics = TRUE) is implemented on most platforms via\n\tselect.list() or tk_select.list().\n\n    o\tNew function message() in 'base' for generating &quot;simple&quot;\n\tdiagnostic messages, replacing such a function in the\n\t'methods' package.\n\n    o\tna.contiguous() is now (S3) generic with first argument\n\trenamed to 'object'.\n\n    o\tNew function normalizePath() to find canonical paths (and on\n\tWindows, canonical names of components).\n\n    o\tThe default in options(&quot;expressions&quot;) has been increased to 5000,\n\tand the maximal settable value to 500000.\n\n    o\tp.adjust() has a new method &quot;BY&quot;.\n\n    o\tpbeta() now uses a different algorithm for large values of at\n\tleast one of the shape parameters, which is much faster and is\n\taccurate and reliable for very large values.  (This affects\n\tpbinom(), pf(), qbeta() and other functions using pbeta at C\n\tlevel.)\n\n    o\tpch=&quot;.&quot; now by default produces a rectangle at least 0.01&quot; per\n\tside on high-resolution devices.  (It used to be one-pixel\n\tsquare even on high-resolution screens and Windows printers,\n\tbut 1/72&quot; on postscript() and pdf() devices.)  Additionally,\n\tthe size is now scalable by 'cex'; see ?points and note that\n\tthe details are subject to change.\n\n    o\tpdf() now responds to the 'paper' and 'pagecentre'\n\targuments.  The default value of 'paper' is &quot;special&quot;\n\tfor backward-compatibility (this is different from the\n\tdefault for postscript()).\n\n    o\tplot.data.frame() tries harder to produce sensible plots for\n\tnon-numeric data frames with one or two columns.\n\n    o\tThe predict() methods for &quot;prcomp&quot; and &quot;princomp&quot; now match\n\tthe columns of 'newdata' to the original fit using column\n\tnames if these are available.\n\n    o\tNew function recordGraphics() to encapsulate calculations\n\tand graphics output together on graphics engine display list.\n\tTo be used with care.\n\n    o\tNew function RSiteSearch() to query R-related resources\n\ton-line (contributed by Jonathan Baron and Andy Liaw).\n\n    o\tscan() arranges to share storage of duplicated character\n\tstrings read in: this can dramatically reduce the memory\n\trequirements for large character vectors which will\n\tsubsequently be turned into factors with relatively few\n\tlevels.\t For a million items this halved the time and reduced\n\tstorage by a factor of 20.\n\n\tscan() has a new argument 'allowEscapes' (default TRUE) that\n\tcontrols when C-style escapes in the input are interpreted.\n\tPreviously only \\n and \\r were interpreted, and then only\n\twithin quoted strings when no separator was supplied.\n\n\tscan() used on an open connection now pushes back on the\n\tconnection its private `ungetc' and so is safer to use to\n\tread partial lines.\n\n    o\tscatter.smooth() and loess.smooth() now handle missing values\n\tin their inputs.\n\n    o\tseq.Date() and seq.POSIXt() now allow 'to' to be before 'from'\n\tif 'by' is negative.\n\n    o\tsprintf() has been enhanced to allow the POSIX/XSI specifiers\n\tlike &quot;%2$6d&quot;, and also accepts &quot;%x&quot; and &quot;%X&quot;.\n\n\tsprintf() does limited coercion of its arguments.\n\n\tsprintf() accepts vector arguments and operates on them in\n\tparallel (after re-cycling if needed).\n\n    o\tNew function strtrim() to trim character vectors to a display\n\twidth, allowing for double-width characters in multi-byte\n\tcharacter sets.\n\n    o\tsubset() now has a method for matrices, similar to that for\n\tdata frames.\n\n    o\tFaster algorithm in summaryRprof().\n\n    o\tsunflowerplot() has new arguments 'col' and 'bg'.\n\n    o\tsys.function() now has argument 'which' (as has long been\n\tpresaged on its help page).\n\n    o\tSys.setlocale(&quot;LC_ALL&quot;, ) now only sets the locale categories\n\twhich R uses, and Sys.setlocale(&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;, ) now gives a\n\twarning (as it can cause R to malfunction).\n\n    o\tunclass() is no longer allowed for environments and external\n\tpointers (since these cannot be copied and so unclass() was\n\tdestructive of its argument).  You can still change the\n\t&quot;class&quot; attribute.\n\n    o\tFile-name matching is no longer case-insensitive with unz()\n\tconnections, even on Windows.\n\n    o\tNew argument 'immediate.' to warning() to send an immediate\n\twarning.\n\n    o\tNew convenience wrappers write.csv() and write.csv2().\n\n    o\tThere is a new version for write.table() which is implemented in C.\n\tFor simple matrices and data frames this is several times\n\tfaster than before, and uses negligible memory compared to the\n\tobject size.\n\n\tThe old version (which no longer coerces a matrix to a data\n\tframe and then back to a matrix) is available for now as\n\twrite.table0().\n\n    o\tThe functions xinch(), yinch(), and xyinch() have been moved\n\tfrom package 'grDevices' into package 'graphics'.\n\n\n    o\tPlotmath now allows underline in expressions.  (PR#7286,\n\tcontributed by Uwe Ligges.)\n\n    o\tBATCH on Unix no longer sets --gui=&quot;none&quot; as the X11 module\n\tis only loaded if needed.\n\n    o\tThe X11 module (and the hence X11(), jpeg() and png() devices\n\tand the X-based dataentry editor) is now in principle\n\tavailable under all Unix GUIs except --gui=&quot;none&quot;, and this is\n\treflected in capabilities().\n\n\tcapabilities(&quot;X11&quot;) determines if an X server can be accessed,\n\tand so is more likely to be accurate.\n\n    o\tPrinting of arrays now honours the 'right' argument if there\n\tare more than two dimensions.\n\n    o\tTabular printing of numbers now has headers right-justified, as\n\tthey were prior to version 1.7.0 (spotted by Rob Baer).\n\n    o\tLazy-loading databases are now cached in memory at first use:\n\tthis enables R to run much faster from slow file systems such\n\tas USB flash drives.  There is a small (less than 2Mb)\n\tincrease in default memory usage.\n\n    o\tThe implicit class structure for numeric vectors has been\n\tchanged, so that integer/real vectors try first methods for\n\tclass &quot;integer&quot;/&quot;double&quot; and then those for class &quot;numeric&quot;.\n\n\tThe implicit classes for matrices and arrays have been changed\n\tto be &quot;matrix&quot;/&quot;array&quot; followed by the class(es) of the\n\tunderlying vector.\n\n    o\tsplines::splineDesign() now allows the evaluation of a B-spline\n\tbasis everywhere instead of just inside the &quot;inner&quot; knots, by\n\tsetting the new argument `outer.ok = TRUE'.\n\n    o\tHashing has been tweaked to use half as much memory as before.\n\n    o\tReadline is not used for tilde expansion when R is run with\n\t--no-readline, nor from embedded applications.\tThen &quot;~name&quot;\n\tis no longer expanded, but &quot;~&quot; still is.\n\n    o\tThe regular expression code is now based on that in glibc 2.3.3.\n\tIt has stricter conformance to POSIX, so metachars such as\n\t{ } + * may need to be escaped where before they did not\n\t(but could have been).\n\n    o\tNew encoding 'TeXtext.enc' improves the way postscript() works\n\twith Computer Modern fonts.\n\n    o\tReplacement in a non-existent column of a data frame tries\n\tharder to create a column of the correct length and so avoid a\n\tcorrupt data frame.\n\n    o\tFor Windows and readline-based history, the saved file size is\n\tre-read from R_HISTSIZE immediately before saving.\n\n    o\tCollected warnings during start-up are now printed before the\n\tinitial prompt rather than after the first command.\n\n    o\tChanges to package 'grid':\n\n\t- preDrawDetails(), drawDetails(), and postDrawDetails()\n\t  methods are now recorded on the graphics engine\n\t  display list.\t  This means that calculations within these\n\t  methods are now run when a device is resized or\n\t  when output is copied from one device to another.\n\n\t- Fixed bug in grid.text() when 'rot' argument has length 0.\n\t  (privately reported by Emmanuel Paradis)\n\n\t- New getNames() function to return just the names of all top-level\n\t  grobs on the display list.\n\n\t- Recording on the grid display list is turned off within\n\t  preDrawDetails(), drawDetails(), and postDrawDetails() methods.\n\n\t- Grid should recover better from errors or user-interrupts\n\t  during drawing (i.e., not leave you in a strange viewport\n\t  or with strange graphical parameter settings).\n\n\t- New function grid.refresh() to redraw the grid display list.\n\n\t- New function grid.record() to capture calculations\n\t  with grid graphics output.\n\n\t- grobWidth and grobHeight (&quot;grobwidth&quot; and &quot;grobheight&quot; units)\n\t  for primitives (text, rects, etc, ...) are now\n\t  calculated based on a bounding box for the relevant grob.\n\n\t  NOTE: this has changed the calculation of the size of a scalar\n\t  rect (or circle or lines).\n\n\t- New arguments 'warn' and 'wrap' for function grid.grab()\n\n\t- New function grid.grabExpr() which captures the output from\n\t  an expression (i.e., not from the current scene) without\n\t  doing any drawing (i.e., no impact on the current scene).\n\n\t- upViewport() now (invisibly) returns the path that it goes up\n\t  (suggested by Ross Ihaka).\n\n\t- The 'gamma' gpar has been deprecated (this is a device property\n\t  not a property of graphical objects;\tsuggested by Ross Ihaka).\n\n\t- New 'lex' gpar;  a line width multiplier.\n\n\t- grid.text() now handles any language object as mathematical\n\t  annotation (instead of just expressions).\n\n\t- plotViewport() has default value for 'margins' argument (that match\n\t  the default value for par(mar)).\n\n\t- The 'extension' argument to dataViewport() can now be vector,\n\t  in which case the first value is used to extend the xscale and\n\t  the second value is used to extend the y scale.\n\t  (suggested by Ross Ihaka).\n\n\t- All 'just' arguments (for viewports, layouts, rectangles, text)\n\t  can now be numeric values (typically between 0 [left] and 1 [right])\n\t  as well as character values (&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, ...).\n\n\t  For rectangles and text, there are additional 'hjust' and 'vjust'\n\t  arguments which allow numeric vectors of justification in\n\t  each direction (e.g., so that several pieces of text can have\n\t  different justifications).\n\t  (suggested by Ross Ihaka)\n\n\t- New 'edits' argument for grid.xaxis() and grid.yaxis() to\n\t  allow specification of on-the-fly edits to axis children.\n\n\t- applyEdit(x, edit) returns x if target of edit (i.e., child\n\t  specified by a gPath) cannot be found.\n\n\t- Fix for calculation of length of max/min/sum unit.  Length is\n\t  now (correctly) reported as 1 (was reported as length of first arg).\n\n\t- Viewport names can now be any string (they used to have to be a\n\t  valid R symbol).\n\n\t- The 'label' argument for grid.xaxis() and grid.yaxis() can now\n\t  also be a language object or string vector, in which case it\n\t  specifies custom labels for the tick marks.\n\n\nINTERNATIONALIZATION\n\n    o\tUnix-alike versions of R can now be used in UTF-8 and other\n\tmulti-byte locales on suitably equipped OSes if configured\n\twith option --enable-mbcs (which is the default).  [The\n\tchanges to font handling in the X11 module are based on the\n\tJapanization patches of Eiji Nakama.]\n\n\tWindows versions of R can be used in `East Asian' locales on\n\tsuitable versions of Windows.\n\n\tSee the 'Internationalization' chapter in the 'Installation\n\tand Administration' manual.\n\n    o\tNew command-line flag --encoding to specify the encoding to\n\tbe assumed for stdin (but not for a console).\n\n    o\tNew function iconv() to convert character vectors between\n\tencodings, on those OSes which support this.  See the new\n\tcapabilities(&quot;iconv&quot;).\n\n    o\tThe meaning of 'encoding' for a connection has changed: it now\n\tallows any charset encoding supported by iconv on the\n\tplatform, and can re-encode output as well as input.\n\n\tAs the new specification is a character string and the old was\n\tnumeric, this should not cause incorrect operation.\n\n    o\tNew function localeToCharset() to find/guess encoding(s) from\n\tthe locale name.\n\n    o\tnchar() returns the true number of bytes stored (including any\n\tembedded nuls), this being 2 for missing values.  It has an\n\toptional argument 'type' with possible non-default values\n\t&quot;chars&quot; and &quot;width&quot; to give the number of characters or the\n\tdisplay width in columns.\n\n    o\tCharacters can be entered in hexadecimal as e.g. \\x9c, and in\n\tUTF-8 and other multibyte locales as \\uxxxx, \\u{xxxx},\n\t\\Uxxxxxxxx or \\U{xxxxxxxx}.  Non-printable Unicode characters\n\tare displayed C-style as \\uxxxx or \\Uxxxxxxxx.\n\n    o\tLC_MONETARY is set to the locale, which affects the result of\n\tSys.localeconv(), but nothing else in R itself.\t (It could\n\taffect add-on packages.)\n\n    o\tsource() now has an 'encoding' argument which can be used to\n\tmake it try out various possible encodings.  This is made use\n\tof by example() which will convert (non-UTF-8) Latin-1 example\n\tfiles in a UTF-8 locale.\n\n    o\tread/writeChar() work in units of characters, not bytes.\n\n    o\t.C() now accepts an ENCODING= argument where re-encoding is\n\tsupported by the OS.  See `Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tdelimMatch (tools) now reports match positions and lengths in\n\tunits of characters, not bytes.\t The delimiters can be\n\tstrings, not just single ASCII characters.\n\n    o\t.Rd files can indicate via a \\encoding{} argument the encoding\n\tthat should be assumed for non-ASCII characters they contain.\n\n    o\tPhrases in .Rd files can be marked by \\enc{}{} to show a\n\ttransliteration to ASCII for use in e.g. text help.\n\n    o\tThe use of 'pch' in points() now allows for multi-byte character\n\tsets: in such a locale a glyph can either be specified as a\n\tmulti-byte single character or as a number, the Unicode point.\n\n    o\tNew function l10n_info() reports on aspects of the\n\tlocale/charset currently in use.\n\n    o\tscan() is now aware of double-byte locales such as Shift-JIS\n\tin which ASCII characters can occur as the second ('trail')\n\tbyte.\n\n    o\tFunctions sQuote() and dQuote() use the Unicode directional\n\tquotes if in a UTF-8 locale.\n\n    o\tThe infrastructure is now in place for C-level error and warning\n\tmessages to be translated and used on systems with Native\n\tLanguage Support.  This has been used for the startup message\n\tin English and to translate Americanisms such as 'color' into\n\tEnglish: translations to several other languages are under\n\tway, and some are included in this release.\n\n\tSee 'Writing R Extensions' for how to make use of this in a\n\tpackage: all the standard packages have been set up to do\n\ttranslation, and the 'language' '<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">en at quot</A>' is implemented to\n\tallow Unicode directional quotes in a UTF-8 locale.\n\n    o\tR-level stop(), warning() and message() messages can be\n\ttranslated, as can other messages via the new function\n\tgettext(). Tools xgettext() and xgettext2pot() are provided in\n\tpackage tools to help manage error messages.\n\n\tgettextf() is a new wrapper to call sprintf() using\n\tgettext() on the format string.\n\n    o\tFunction ngettext() allows the management of singular and\n\tplural forms of messages.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tNew functions mirror2html() and checkCRAN().\n\n    o\tR CMD check has a new option '--use-valgrind'.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now checks that Fortran and C++ files have LF\n\tline endings, as well as C files.  It also checks Makevars[.in]\n\tfiles for portable compilation flags.\n\n    o\tR CMD check will now work on a source tarball and prints out\n\tinformation about the version of R and the package.\n\n    o\ttools:::.install_package_code_files() (used to collate R files\n\twhen installing packages) ensures files are separated by a\n\tline feed.\n\n    o\tvignette() now returns an object of class &quot;vignette&quot; whose\n\tprint() method opens the corresponding PDF file.  The edit()\n\tmethod can be used to open the code of the vignette in an\n\teditor.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL on Unix has a new option '--build' matching\n\tthat on Windows, to package as tarball the installed package.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL on Unix can now install binary bundles.\n\n    o\tR CMD build now changes src files to LF line endings if necessary.\n\n    o\tR CMD build now behaves consistently between source and binary\n\tbuilds: in each case it prepares a source directory and then\n\teither packages that directory as a tarball or calls R CMD\n\tINSTALL --build on the prepared sources.\n\n\tThis means that R CMD build --binary now respects\n\t.Rbuildignore and will rebuild vignettes (unless the option\n\t--no-vignettes is used).  For the latter, it now installs the\n\tcurrent sources into a temporary library and uses that version\n\tof the package/bundle to rebuild the vignettes.\n\n    o\tR CMD build now reports empty directories in the source tree.\n\n    o\tNew function write_PACKAGES() in package 'tools' to help with\n\tpreparing local package repositories.  (Based on a contribution\n\tby Uwe Ligges.)\t How to prepare such repositories is\n\tdocumented in the 'R Installation and Administration' manual.\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() adds a bit more to DESCRIPTION.\n\n    o\tSweave changes:\n\n\t- \\usepackage[nogin]{Sweave} in the header of an Sweave file\n\t  supresses auto-setting of the graphical parameter like width\n\t  of graphics.\n\n\t- The new \\SweaveInput{} command works similar to LaTeX's\n\t  \\input{} command.\n\n\t- Option value strip.white=all strips all blank lines from the\n\t  output of a code chunk.\n\n\t- Code chunks with eval=false are commented out by Stangle() and\n\t  hence no longer tested by R CMD check.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n    o\tFile doc/html/faq.html no longer exists, and doc/manual/R-FAQ.html\n\t(which has active links to other manuals) is used instead.\n\t(If makeinfo &gt;= 4.7 is not available, the version on CRAN is\n\tlinked to.)\n\n    o\tManual 'Writing R Extensions' has further details on writing\n\tnew front-ends for R using the new public header files.\n\n    o\tThere are no longer any restrictions on characters in the\n\t\\name{} field of a .Rd file: in particular _ is supported.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tThere are new public C/C++ header files Rinterface.h and\n\tR_ext/RStartup.h for use with external GUIs.\n\n    o\tAdded an onExit() function to graphics devices, to be executed\n\tupon user break if non-NULL.\n\n    o\tISNAN now works even in C++ code that undefines the 'isnan' macro.\n\n    o\tR_alloc's limit on 64-bit systems has been raised from just\n\tunder 2^31 bytes (2Gb) to just under 2^34 (16Gb), and is now checked.\n\n    o\tNew math utility functions  log1pmx(x), lgamma1p(x),\n\tlogspace_add(logx, logy), and logspace_sub(logx, logy).\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe aqua module for MacOS X has been removed: --with-aqua now\n\trefers to the unbundled Cocoa GUI.\n\n    o\tCapabilities &quot;bzip2&quot;, &quot;GNOME, &quot;libz&quot; and &quot;PCRE&quot; are defunct.\n\n    o\tThe undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument was\n\tdeprecated in 2.0.1 and is now regarded as an error.\n\n    o\tCapability &quot;IEEE754&quot; is deprecated.\n\n    o\tThe 'CRAN' argument to update.packages(), old.packages(),\n\tnew.packages(), download.packages() and install.packages() is\n\tdeprecated in favour of 'repos', which replaces it as a\n\tpositional argument (so this is only relevant for calls with\n\tnamed args).\n\n    o\tThe S3 methods for getting and setting names of &quot;dist&quot; objects\n\thave been removed (as they provided names with a different\n\tlength from the &quot;dist&quot; object itself).\n\n    o\tOption &quot;repositories&quot; is no longer used and so not set.\n\n    o\tloadURL() is deprecated in favour of load(url()).\n\n    o\tdelay() is deprecated.\tUse delayAssign() instead.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tNew configure option --enable-utf8 to enable support for\n\tUTF-8 locales, on by default.\n\n    o\tR_XTRA_[CF]FLAGS are now used during the configuration tests,\n\tand [CF]PICFLAGS if --enable-R-shlib was specified.  This\n\tensures that features such as inlining are only used if the\n\tcompilation flags specified support them.  (PR#7257)\n\n    o\tFiles FAQ, RESOURCES, doc/html/resources.html are no longer in\n\tthe SVN sources but are made by 'make dist'.\n\n    o\tThe GNOME GUI is unbundled, now provided as a package on CRAN.\n\n    o\tConfiguring without having the recommended packages is now an\n\terror unless --with-recommended-packages=no (or equivalent) is used.\n\n    o\tConfiguring without having the X11 headers and libraries is now\n\tan error unless --with-x=no (or equivalent) is used.\n\n    o\tConfigure tries harder to find a minimal set of FLIBS.\tUnder\n\tsome circumstances this may remove from R_LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\tpath elements that ought to have specified in LDFLAGS (but\n\twere not).\n\n    o\tThe C code for most of the graphics device drivers and their\n\tafm files are now in package grDevices.\n\n    o\tR is now linked against ncurses/termlib/termcap only if\n\treadline is specified (now the default) and that requires it.\n\n    o\tMakeinfo 4.7 or later is now required for building the HTML and\n\tInfo versions of the manuals.\n\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThere are new types of packages, identified by the Type field\n\tin the DESCRIPTION file.  For example the GNOME console is now\n\ta separate package (on CRAN), and translations can be\n\tdistributed as packages.\n\n    o\tThere is now support of installing from within R both source and\n\tbinary packages on MacOS X and Windows.\t Most of the R\n\tfunctions now have a 'type' argument defaulting to\n\tgetOption(&quot;pkgType&quot;) and with possible values &quot;source&quot;,\n\t&quot;win.binary&quot; and &quot;mac.binary&quot;.\tThe default is &quot;source&quot; except\n\tunder Windows and the CRAN GUI build for MacOS X.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() and friends now accept a vector of URLs for\n\t'repos' or 'contriburl' and get the newest available version of\n\ta package from the first repository on the list in which it is\n\tfound.\tThe argument 'CRAN' is still accepted, but deprecated.\n\n\tinstall.packages() on Unix can now install from local .tar.gz\n\tfiles via repos = NULL (as has long been done on Windows).\n\n\tinstall.packages() no longer asks if downloaded packages\n\tshould be deleted: they will be deleted at the end of the\n\tsession anyway (and can be deleted by the user at any time).\n\n\tIf the repository provides the information, install.packages()\n\twill now accept the name of a package in a bundle.\n\n\tIf 'pkgs' is omitted install.packages() will use a listbox to\n\tdisplay the available packages, on suitable systems.\n\n\t'dependencies' can be a character vector to allow only some\n\tlevels of dependencies (e.g. not &quot;Suggests&quot;) to be requested.\n\n    o\tThere is a new possible value update.packages(ask=&quot;graphics&quot;)\n\tthat uses a widget to (de)select packages, on suitable systems.\n\n    o\tThe option used is now getOption(&quot;repos&quot;) not getOption(&quot;CRAN&quot;)\n\tand it is initially set to a dummy value.  Its value can be a\n\tcharacter vector (preferably named) giving one or several\n\trepositories.\n\n\tA new function chooseCRANmirror() will select a CRAN mirror.\n\tThis is called automatically if the contrib.url() encounters\n\tthe initial dummy value of getOption(&quot;repos&quot;)\n\n\tA new function setRepositories() can be used to create\n\tgetOption(&quot;repos&quot;) from a (platform-specific) list of known\n\trepositories.\n\n    o\tNew function new.packages() to report uninstalled packages\n\tavailable at the requested repositories.  This also reports\n\tincomplete bundles.  It will optionally install new packages.\n\n    o\tNew function available.packages(), similar to CRAN.packages()\n\tbut for use with multiple repositories.\t Both now only report\n\tpackages whose R version requirements are met.\n\n    o\tupdate.packages() and old.packages() have a new option\n\t'checkBuilt' to allow packages installed under earlier\n\tversions of R to be updated.\n\n    o\tremove.packages() can now remove bundles.\n\n    o\tThe Contains: field of the DESCRIPTION file of package bundles\n\tis now installed, so later checks can find out if the bundle\n\tis complete.\n\n    o\tpackageStatus() is now built on top of *.packages, and gains a\n\t'method' argument.  It defaults to the same repositories as\n\tthe other tools, those specified by getOption(&quot;repos&quot;).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tConfiguring for Tcl/Tk makes use of ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_LIBS}\n\tnot ${TK_LIB_SPEC} ${TK_XLIBSW}, which is correct for\n\trecent versions of Tk, but conceivably not for old\n\ttkConfig.sh files.\n\n    o\tdetach() was not recomputing the S4 methods for primitives\n\tcorrectly.\n\n    o\tMethods package now has class &quot;expression&quot; partly fixed in basic\n\tclasses, so S4 classes can extend these (but &quot;expression&quot; is\n\tpretty broken as a vector class in R).\n\n    o\tCollected warnings had messages with unneeded trailing space.\n\n    o\tS4 methods for primitive functions must be exported from\n\tnamespaces; this is now done automatically.\n\tNote that is.primitive() is now in &quot;base&quot;, not &quot;methods&quot;.\n\n    o\tPackage grid:\n\n\t- Fixed bug in grid.text() when &quot;rot&quot; argument has length 0.\n\t  (reported by Emmanuel Paradis)\n\n    o\t.install_package_vignette_index() created an index even in an\n\tempty 'doc' directory.\n\n    o\tThe print() method for factors now escapes characters in the\n\tlevels in the same way as they are printed.\n\n    o\tstr() removed any class from environment objects.\n\n\tstr() no longer interprets control characters in character\n\tstrings and factor levels; also no longer truncates factor\n\tlevels unless they are longer than 'nchar.max'.\n\tTruncation of such long strings is now indicated ''outside''\n\tthe string.\n\n\tstr(&lt;S4.object&gt;) was misleading for the case of a single slot.\n\n\tstr() now also properly displays S4 class definitions (such as\n\treturned by getClass().\n\n    o\tprint.factor(quote=TRUE) was not quoting levels, causing\n\tambiguity when the levels contained spaces or quotes.\n\n    o\tR CMD check was confused by a trailing / on a package name.\n\n    o\twrite.table() was writing incorrect column names if the data\n\tframe contained any matrix-like columns.\n\n    o\twrite.table() was not quoting row names for a 0-column x.\n\n    o\tt(x)'s default method now also preserves names(dimnames(x)) for\n\t1D arrays 'x'.\n\n    o\tr &lt;- a %*% b no longer produces names(dimnames(r)) == c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\n\tunless one of a or b has named dimnames.\n\n    o\tSome .Internal functions that were supposed to return invisibly\n\tdid not. This was behind PR#7397 and PR#7466.\n\n    o\teval(expr, NULL, encl) now looks up variables in encl, as\n\teval(expr, list(), encl) always did\n\n    o\tCoercing as.data.frame(NULL) to a pairlist caused an error.\n\n    o\tp.adjust(p, ..) now correctly works when `p' contains NAs (or when\n\tit is of length 0 or length 2 for method = &quot;hommel&quot;).\n\n    o\t'methods' initialization was calling a function intended for\n\t.Call() with .C().\n\n    o\toptim() needed a check that the objective function returns a\n\tvalue of length 1 (spotted by Ben Bolker).\n\n    o\tX11() was only scaling its fonts to pointsize if the dpi\n\twas within 0.5 of 100dpi.\n\n    o\tX11() font selection was looking for any symbol font, and\n\tsometimes got e.g. bold italic if the server has such a font.\n\n    o\tdpois(*, lambda=Inf) now returns 0 (or -Inf for log).\n\n    o\tUsing pch=&quot;&quot; gave a square (pch=0)!  Now it is regarded as the\n\tsame as NA, which was also undocumented but omits the point.\n\n    o\tBase graphics now notices (ab)lines which have a zero\n\tcoordinate on log scale, and omits them.  (PR#7559)\n\n    o\tstop() and warning() now accept NULL as they are documented\n\tto do (although this seems of little use and is equivalent to &quot;&quot;).\n\n    o\tweighted.mean() now checks the length of the weight vector w.\n\n    o\tgetAnywhere() was confused by names with leading or trailing dots\n\t(spotted by Robert McGehee)\n\n    o\teval() was not handling values from return() correctly.\n\n    o\tpar(omd) is now of the form c(x1, x2, y1, y2) to match the\n\tdocumentation and for S-PLUS compatibility.\n\n\t[Previously, par(omd) was of the form c(bottom, left, top, right)\n\t like par(oma) and par(omi)]\n\n    o\tformatC() did not check its 'flag' argument, and could\n\tsegfault if it was incorrect. (PR#7686)\n\n    o\tContrasts needed to be coerced to numeric (e.g. from integer)\n\tinside model.matrix.  (PR#7695)\n\n    o\tsocketSelect() did not check for buffered input.\n\n    o\tReads on a non-blocking socket with no available data were\n\tnot handled properly and could result in a segfault.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;aovlist&quot; method for se.contrast() failed in some very\n\tsimple cases that were effectively not multistratum designs,\n\te.g. only one treatment occurring in only one stratum.\n\n    o\tpgamma() uses completely re-written algorithms, and should work\n\tfor all (even very extreme) arguments; this is based on Morten\n\tWelinder's contribution related to PR#7307.\n\n    o\tdpois(10, 2e-308, log=TRUE) and similar cases gave -Inf.\n\n    o\tx &lt;- 2^(0:1000);    plot(x, x^.9, type=&quot;l&quot;, log=&quot;xy&quot;)# and\n\tx &lt;- 2^-(1070:170); plot(x, x^.9, type=&quot;l&quot;, log=&quot;xy&quot;)# now both work\n\n    o\tsummary.lm() asked for a report on a reasonable occurrence, but\n\tthe check failed to take account of NAs.\n\n    o\tlm() was miscalculating 'df.residual' for empty models with a\n\tmatrix response.\n\n    o\tsummary.lm() now behaves more sensibly for empty models.\n\n    o\tplot.window() was using the wrong sign when adjusting\n\txlim/ylim for positive 'asp' and a reversed axis.\n\n    o\tIf malloc() fails when allocating a large object the allocator now\n\tdoes a gc and tries the malloc() again.\n\n    o\tpackageSlot() and getGroupMembers() are now exported from the\n\t'methods' package as they should from documentation and the\n\tGreen Book.\n\n    o\trhyper() was giving numbers slightly too small, due to a bug in the\n\toriginal algorithm.  (PR#7314)\n\n    o\tgsub() was sometimes incorrectly matching ^ inside a string,\n\te.g.  gsub(&quot;^12&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;1212&quot;) was &quot;xx&quot;.\n\n    o\t[g]sub(perl = TRUE) was giving random results for a 0-length\n\tinitial match.\t(PR#7742)\n\n    o\t[g]sub was ignoring most 0-length matches, including all initial\n\tones.  Note that substitutions such as gsub(&quot;[[:space:]]*&quot;, &quot;\n\t&quot;, ...) now work as they do in 'sed' (whereas the effect was\n\tpreviously the same as gsub(&quot;[[:space:]]+&quot;, &quot; &quot;, ...)).\n\t(In part PR#7742)\n\n    o\tPromises are now evaluated when extracted from an environment\n\tusing '$' or '[[ ]]'.\n\n    o\treshape(direction=&quot;wide&quot;) had some sorting problems when\n\tguessing time points (PR#7669)\n\n    o\tpar() set 'xaxp' before 'xlog' and 'yaxp' before 'ylog',\n\tcausing PR#831.\n\n    o\tThe logic in tclRequire() to check the availability of a Tcl\n\tpackage turned out to be fallible.  It now uses a try()-and-see\n\tmechanism instead.\n\n    o\tOpening a unz() connection on a non-existent file left a file\n\thandle in use.\n\n    o\t&quot;dist&quot; objects of length 0 failed to print.\n\n    o   INSTALL and the libR try harder to find a temporary directory\n\t(since there might be one left over with the same PID).\n\n    o\tacf() could cause a segfault with some datasets.  (PR#7771)\n\n    o\ttan(1+LARGEi) now gives 0+1i rather than 0+NaNi (PR#7781)\n\n    o\tsummary(data.frame(mat = I(matrix(1:8, 4)))) does not go into\n\tinfinite recursion anymore.\n\n    o\twriteBin() performed byte-swapping incorrectly on complex\n\tvectors, also swapping real and imaginary parts. (PR#7778)\n\n    o\tread.table() sometimes discarded as blank lines containing\n\tonly white space, even if sep=&quot;,&quot;.\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

In particular, things like \n\t    split(x, g) &lt;- lapply(split(x, g), mean)\n\tnow work\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n    o\tManual `Writing R Extensions' has new sections on writing\n\tportable packages and on writing new front-ends for R -- the\n\tlatter will be more comprehensive in R 2.1.0 which has new\n\tpublic header files.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe aqua module in MacOS X is deprecated.\n\n    o\tCapabilities &quot;bzip2&quot;, &quot;GNOME, &quot;libz&quot; and &quot;PCRE&quot; are deprecated.\n\n    o\tThe GNOME GUI on Unix-alikes is deprecated as part of R;\n\tit will be available in another form as from R 2.1.0.\n\n    o\tThe undocumented use of UseMethod() with no argument is now\n\tformally deprecated.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tBuilding on Alpha OSF/1 no longer forces the C flag -std1,\n\twhich appears to be no longer needed.  (PR#7257)\n\n    o\tThe compiler flag -mieee-fp is no longer used on i386 Linux\n\t(these days it is only passed to the linker and was only\n\tinvoked for compilation steps).\n\n    o\t-D__NO_MATH_INLINES is only used on older ix86 glibc-based\n\tsystems which need it (tested at configure time).  This leads to\n\tsmall improvements in speed and accuracy on modern systems.\n\n    o\tIf makeinfo &gt;= 4.5 is not available, warnings are given that\n\tsome of the HTML manuals will be missing, and the index page\n\tgiven by help.start() will link to CRAN versions of those manuals.\n\n    o\tFiles aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 used in maintainer builds\n\tare not longer included in the distribution.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tIt was not clear in 'Writing R Extensions' that some of the\n\tentry points in the 'Utilities' section were not declared in\n\t&lt;R.h&gt; (they were in &lt;R_ext/Applic.h&gt;).  Now all the entry\n\tpoints in that section are declared in &lt;R_ext/Utils.h&gt;,\n\tincluded by &lt;R.h&gt;.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   The grid.grab() function in package grid would throw an error\n\tif there were no viewports pushed (now returns NULL).\n\n    o\tmodel.frame.default() takes row names from the response\n\tvariable if that has suitable names and there is no 'data'\n\targument.  (This follows S but was not previously implemented\n\tin R.)\n\n    o\twrite.table() was not respecting the 'dec' argument for complex\n\tnumbers.\n\n    o\twrite.table() printed a mixture of numeric and complex numbers\n\tas all complex.\t (PR#7260)\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL failed with versioned installs on packages which\n\tsave images (only).\n\n    o\tdlogis() gave NaN not 0 for large negative arguments.\n\n    o\tImporting from another namespace was broken for versioned\n\tinstalls, incorrectly reporting something like\n\t&quot;package 'imported_from' does not have a name space&quot;.\n\n    o\tThe GNOME interface under Linux/Unix was broken. (PR#7276)\n\n    o\tFor the jpeg/png devices under Linux/Unix, under certain rare\n\tcircumstances clipping needed to be cleared before starting a\n\tnew page.  (PR#7270, which has been the case since the devices\n\twere introduced in 1.1.0.)\n\n    o\tFirst lattice plot (first grid.newpage() call) did not start\n\ta new page IF there had been a previous traditional graphics\n\tplot (on the same device).\n\n    o\tUsing install.packages() to install the same package to more\n\tthan one library gave an incorrect warning message.  (If there\n\twere two or more such packages it might give an error.)\n\n    o\t.packages(all.available=TRUE) returned packages with an invalid\n\tversion field in their DESCRIPTION whereas .find.packages() and\n\tpackageDescription() did not.  Now all do not.\n\n    o\tpackageDescription() now correctly reports that a package does\n\tnot exist, rather than that its DESCRIPTION file is 'missing\n\tor broken'.\n\n    o\t'make dist' from builddir != sourcedir was copying not linking\n\trecommended packages to *.tgz.\n\n    o\tSlots in prototype objects can inherit from locally defined\n\tclasses (which were not being found correctly before).\n\n    o\tSeveral fixes to the behavior of as() when there are either\n\tcoerce= or replace= methods supplied in a call to\n\tsetIs(). Related fixes to setIs() to handle correctly previous\n\tmethods, if there were any.\n\n    o\tsplinefun(1[0], 1[0])(1) doesn't segfault anymore (PR#7290).\n\tspline() and splinefun() now also work with missing values by\n\tomiting them.\n\n    o\tecdf() was failing on inputs containing NAs. (Part of PR#7292)\n\n    o\ttools:::.install_package_description was splitting the Built:\n\tfield across lines on platforms with very long names.\n\n    o\tcapabilities() was wrong for the Aqua GUI on MacOS X.\n\n    o   Using Rprof() with a non-writable 'file' argument is now a \n\tnon-fatal error and does not abort R.\n\n    o   binom.test() did not deparse its arguments early enough such\n        that the reported data were ugly if x was a table.\n\n    o\tSystems based on glibc, including those using R's substitute for\n\tstrptime, were handling strptime(&quot;2001&quot;, &quot;%Y&quot;) incorrectly, in\n\tsome cases crashing.  R's substitute code has been corrected\n\t(but problems may remain if glibc is used).  See the ?strptime\n\tfor what should happen (which is system-specific).\n\n    o\tuntrace() after trace() failed if package 'methods' was attached.\n\t(PR#7301)\n\n    o\tsummary.stepfun() was reporting for n &gt; 6 summaries of the\n\tknots and levels as the actual values.  Both print() and\n\tsummary() methods called the constant values &quot;step heights&quot;,\n\talthough they were not the heights of the steps.\n\n    o\tis.na/is.nan() were giving spurious warnings if applied to a\n\traw vector.\n\n    o\tis.atomic() gave incorrect result (false) for a raw vector.\n\n    o\trank() and order() accepted raw and list inputs, but did not\n\tgive a sensible answer (always 1:n).  Similarly, partial sorts\n\tof a raw vector were accepted but did nothing.\n\n    o\trequire() without a version argument tried for an unversioned\n\tload of a package even though a versioned install was already\n\tloaded.  This often led to a message that a required package\n\twas being loaded when it was not actually being loaded.\n\n    o\tstr(&lt;S4.object&gt;) made use of attributes() instead of slot(),\n\tand hence didn't properly print NULL slots.\n\n    o\tcontrib.url() now handles URLs ending in '/' correctly.\n\n    o\tstr() removed any class from externalptr objects.\n\n    o\tlogLik() and hence AIC() failed or gave incorrect answers \n\ton &quot;lm&quot; fits with na.action = na.exclude (and perhaps other \n\tna.actions's except na.omit and na.fail).\n\n    o\tpmax() and pmin() sometimes used NAs in internal subassignments,\n\tand sometimes these failed.\n\n    o\tSubassigning an expression, e.g. expr[2] &lt;- 1, could leave an\n\tinvalid object and so cause a segfault. (PR#7326)\n\n    o\tdownload/install.packages() would misbehave if there was more\n\tthan one version of a package in a repository.\n\n    o\tsort(partial=) silently ignored some other arguments: using\n\t'decreasing' or 'index.return' or supplying a factor are now\n\terrors.\n\t\n    o   The ave() function had trouble if the grouping contained \n        unused levels. \n\t\n    o   read.fwf() got confused by skip &gt; 0 and could infinite loop\n\tunder some circumstances.  (PR#7350)\n\n    o\tupgrade(x, ask = FALSE) was broken for a &quot;packageStatus&quot; object.\n\n    o   Class &quot;raw&quot; had been omitted from the list of basic classes in\n\tthe &quot;methods&quot; package and so could not be used in S4 classes.\n\n    o   Function getGroupMembers(), part of the definition of S4\n\tclasses, had been promised for release 2.0, but slipped through.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a new version\nwith a number of new features. See below for the details.\n\nAs was the case with R 1.0.0, this new version represents a coming of\nage more than a radical change to R. We do plan to celebrate the new\nmajor version with press releases and such.\n\nThe release will be available from \n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.0.0.tar.gz\">http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.0.0.tar.gz</A>\n\nor you might wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n \nThere is also a version split for floppies.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team\n        Peter Dalgaard\n\n\n\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\n3900bca37cabb4b76b8d736d51cc9251  R-2.0.0.tar.gz\n4a3c7595b112d879997f7455fa8c1c0d  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.aa\n45d376c7c533c62c657ef0fafac8a784  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ab\n7dbdb241e1fb7263701719ea856ebe41  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ac\n1e1077f7593778b79e9b0d5c676af63b  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ad\n6f4ffaa48a54e002f586f80fd4f2461c  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ae\n34b62bb31f6ecf84da329d21c2a21561  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.af\nc880f8f06ca3fe367bba6757e9cfbf32  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ag\nb1a2d17d3ae523d04ffc8d3c6db4b67b  R-2.0.0.tar.gz-split.ah\n\n\nHere is the relevant part of the NEWS file\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe stub packages from 1.9.x have been removed: the library()\n\tfunction selects the new home for their code.\n\n    o\t`Lazy loading' of R code has been implemented, and is used for\n\tthe standard and recommended packages by default.  Rather than\n\tkeep R objects in memory, they are kept in a database on disc\n\tand only loaded on first use.  This accelerates startup (down\n\tto 40% of the time for 1.9.x) and reduces memory usage -- the\n\tlatter is probably unimportant of itself, but reduces\n\tcommensurately the time spent in garbage collection.\n\n\tPackages are by default installed using lazy loading if they\n\thave more than 25Kb of R code and did not use a saved image.\n\tThis can be overridden by INSTALL --[no-]lazy or via a field\n\tin the DESCRIPTION file.  Note that as with --save, any other\n\tpackages which are required must be already installed.\n\n\tAs the lazy-loading databases will be consulted often, R\n\twill be slower if run from a slow network-mounted disc.\n\n    o\tAll the datasets formerly in packages 'base' and 'stats' have\n\tbeen moved to a new package 'datasets'.\t data() does the\n\tappropriate substitution, with a warning.  However, calls to\n\tdata() are not normally needed as the data objects are visible\n\tin the 'datasets' package.\n\n\tPackages can be installed to make their data objects visible\n\tvia R CMD INSTALL --lazy-data or via a field in the\n\tDESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o\tPackage 'graphics' has been split into 'grDevices' (the graphics\n\tdevices shared between base and grid graphics) and 'graphics'\n\t(base graphics).  Each of the 'graphics' and 'grid' packages\n\tload 'grDevices' when they are attached.  Note that\n\tps.options() has been moved to grDevices and user hooks may\n\tneed to be updated.\n\n    o\tThe semantics of data() have changed (and were incorrectly\n\tdocumented in recent releases) and the function has been moved\n\tto package 'utils'.  Please read the help page carefully if\n\tyou use the 'package' or 'lib.loc' arguments.\n\n\tdata() now lists datasets, and not just names which data() accepts.\n\n    o\tDataset 'phones' has been renamed to 'WorldPhones'.\n\n    o\tDatasets 'sunspot.month' and 'sunspot.year' are available\n\tseparately but not via data(sunspot) (which was used by package\n\tlattice to retrieve a dataset 'sunspot').\n\n    o\tPackages must have been re-installed for this version, and\n\tlibrary() will enforce this.\n\n    o\tPackage names must now be given exactly in library() and\n\trequire(), regardless of whether the underlying file system is\n\tcase-sensitive or not.\tSo 'library(mass)' will not work, even\n\ton Windows.\n\n    o\tR no longer accepts associative use of relational operators.\n\tThat is, 3 &lt; 2 &lt; 1 (which used to evalute as TRUE!) now causes\n\ta syntax error.\t If this breaks existing code, just add\n\tparentheses -- or braces in the case of plotmath.\n\n    o\tThe R parser now allows multiline strings, without escaping\n\tthe newlines with backslashes (the old method still works).\n\tPatch by Mark Bravington.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tThere is a new atomic vector type, class &quot;raw&quot;.\t See ?raw for\n\tfull details including the operators and utility functions provided.\n\n    o\tThe default barplot() method by default uses a\n\tgamma-corrected grey palette (rather than the heat color\n\tpalette) for coloring its output when given a matrix.\n\n    o\tThe 'formula' method for boxplot() has a 'na.action' argument,\n\tdefaulting to NULL.  This is mainly useful if the response\n\tis a matrix when the previous default of 'na.omit' would omit\n\tentire rows.  (Related to PR#6846.)\n\n\tboxplot() and bxp() now obey global 'par' settings and also\n\tallow the specification of graphical options in more detail,\n\tcompatibly with S-PLUS (fulfilling wishlist entry PR#6832)\n\tthanks to contributions from Arni Magnusson.  For consistency,\n\t'boxwex' is not an explicit argument anymore.\n\n    o\tchull() has been moved to package graphics (as it uses xy.coords).\n\n    o\tThere is now a coef() method for summaries of &quot;nls&quot; objects.\n\n    o\tcompareVersion(), packageDescription() and read.00Index()\n\thave been moved to package 'utils'.\n\n    o\tconvolve(), fft(), mvfft() and nextn() have been moved to\n\tpackage stats.\n\n    o\tcoplot() now makes use of cex.lab and font.lab par() settings.\n\n    o\tcumsum/prod/max/min() now preserve names.\n\n    o\tdata(), .path.packages() and .find.packages() now interpret\n\tpackage = NULL to mean all loaded packages.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() and its replacement methods remove the names from\n\tvector columns.\t Using I() will ensure that names are\n\tpreserved.\n\n    o\tdata.frame(check.names = TRUE) (the default) enforces unique\n\tnames, as S does.\n\n    o\t.Defunct() now has 'new' and 'package' arguments like those of\n\t.Deprecated().\n\n    o\tThe plot() method for &quot;dendrogram&quot; objects now respects many more\n\tnodePar and edgePar settings and for edge labeling computes the\n\textents of the diamond more correctly.\n\n    o\tdeparse(), dput() and dump() have a new 'control' argument to\n\tcontrol the level of detail when deparsing.  dump() defaults to\n\tthe most detail, the others default to less.  See ?.deparseOpts\n\tfor the details.\n\n\tThey now evaluate promises by default: see ?dump for details.\n\n    o\tdir.create() now expands '~' in filenames.\n\n    o\tdownload.file() has a new progress meter (under Unix) if the\n\tlength of the file is known -- it uses 50 equals signs.\n\n    o\tdyn.load() and library.dynam() return an object describing the\n\tDLL that was loaded.  For packages with namespaces, the DLL\n\tobjects are stored in a list within the namespace.\n\n    o\tNew function eapply() - apply for environments.\t The supplied\n\tfunction is applied to each element of the environment; the order\n\tof application is not specified.\n\n    o\tedit() and fix() use the object name in the window caption on\n\tsome platforms (e.g. Windows).\n\n    o\tFunction file.edit() function added: like file.show(), but\n\tallows editing.\n\n    o\tFunction file.info() can return file sizes &gt; 2G if the\n\tunderlying OS supports such.\n\n    o\tfisher.test(*, conf.int=FALSE) allows the confidence interval\n\tcomputation to be skipped.\n\n    o\tformula() methods for classes &quot;lm&quot; and &quot;glm&quot; used the expanded\n\tformula (with '.' expanded) from the terms component.\n\n    o\tThe `formula' method for ftable() now looks for variables in the\n\tenvironment of the formula before the usual search path.\n\n    o\tA new function getDLLRegisteredRoutines() returns information\n\tabout the routines available from a DLL that were explicitly\n\tregistered with R's dynamic loading facilities.\n\n    o\tA new function getLoadedDLLs() returns information about the\n\tDLLs that are currently loaded within this session.\n\n    o\tThe package element returned by getNativeSymbolInfo() contains\n\treference to both the internal object used to resolve symbols\n\twith the DLL, and the internal DllInfo structure used to\n\trepresent the DLL within R.\n\n    o\thelp() now returns information about available documentation for\n\ta given topic, and notifies about multiple matches.  It has a\n\tseparate print() method.\n\n\tIf the latex help files were not installed, help() will offer\n\tto create a latex file on-the-fly from the installed .Rd file.\n\n    o\theatmap() has a new argument 'reorderfun'.\n\n    o\tMost versions of install.packages() have an new optional\n\targument 'dependencies = TRUE' which will not only fetch the\n\tpackages but also their uninstalled dependencies and their\n\tdependencies ....\n\n\tThe Unix version of install.packages() attempts to install\n\tpackages in an order that reflects their dependencies.\t(This\n\tis not needed for binary installs as used under Windows.)\n\n    o\tinteraction() has new argument 'sep'.\n\n    o\tinteraction.plot() allows 'type = &quot;b&quot;' and doesn't give spurious\n\twarnings when passed a matplot()-only argument such as 'main'.\n\n    o\tis.integer() and is.numeric() always return FALSE for a\n\tfactor.\t (Previously they were true and false respectively for\n\twell-formed factors, but it is possible to create factors\n\twith non-integer codes by underhand means.)\n\n    o\tNew functions is.leaf(), dendrapply() and a labels() method for\n\tdendrogram objects.\n\n    o\tlegend() has an argument 'pt.lwd' and setting 'density' now works\n\tbecause 'angle' now defaults to 45 (mostly contributed by Uwe Ligges).\n\n    o\tlibrary() now checks the version dependence (if any) of\n\trequired packages mentioned in the Depends: field of the\n\tDESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o\tload() now detects and gives a warning (rather than an error)\n\tfor empty input, and tries to detect (but not correct) files\n\twhich have had LF replaced by CR.\n\n    o\tls.str() and lsf.str() now return an object of class &quot;ls_str&quot; which\n\thas a print method.\n\n    o\tmake.names() has a new argument allow_, which if false allows\n\tits behaviour in R 1.8.1 to be reproduced.\n\n    o\tThe 'formula' method for mosaicplot() has a 'na.action' argument\n\tdefaulting to 'na.omit'.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() now warns if it is given data = newdata and it\n\tcreates a model frame with a different number of rows from\n\tthat implied by the size of 'newdata'.\n\n\tTime series attributes are never copied to variables in the\n\tmodel frame unless na.action = NULL.  (This was always the\n\tintention, but they sometimes were as the result of an earlier\n\tbug fix.)\n\n    o\tThere is a new 'padj' argument to mtext() and axis().\n\tCode patch provided by Uwe Ligges (fixes PR#1659 and PR#7188).\n\n    o\tFunction package.dependencies() has been moved to package 'tools'.\n\n    o\tThe 'formula' method for pairs() has a 'na.action' argument,\n\tdefaulting to 'na.pass', rather than the value of\n\tgetOption(&quot;na.action&quot;).\n\n    o\tThere are five new par() settings:\n\n\t'family' can be used to specify a font family for graphics\n\ttext.  This is a device-independent family specification\n\twhich gets mapped by the graphics device to a device-specific\n\tfont specification (see, for example, postscriptFonts()).\n\tCurrently, only PostScript, PDF, X11, Quartz, and Windows\n\trespond to this setting.\n\n\t'lend', 'ljoin', and 'lmitre' control the cap style and\n\tjoin style for drawing lines (only noticeable on thick lines\n\tor borders).  Currently, only PostScript, PDF, X11, and Quartz\n\trespond to these settings.\n\n\t'lheight' is a multiplier used in determining the vertical\n\tspacing of multi-line text.\n\n\tAll of these settings are currently only available via par()\n\t(i.e., not in-line as arguments to plot(), lines(), ...)\n\n    o\tPCRE (as used by grep etc) has been updated to version 5.0.\n\n    o\tA 'version' argument has been added to pdf() device.  If this is\n\tset to &quot;1.4&quot;, the device will support transparent colours.\n\n    o\tplot.xy(), the workhorse function of points(), lines() and\n\tplot.default() now has 'lwd' as explicit argument instead of\n\timplicitly in '...', and now recycles lwd where it makes\n\tsense, i.e. for line-based plot symbols.\n\n    o\tThe png() and jpeg() devices (and the bmp() device under Windows)\n\tnow allow a nominal resolution to be recorded in the file.\n\n    o   New functions to control mapping from device-independent\n\tgraphics font family to device-specific family:\n\tpostscriptFont() and postscriptFonts() (for both postscript()\n\tand pdf()); X11Font() and X11Fonts(); windowsFont() and\n\twindowsFonts(); quartzFont() and quartzFonts().\n\n    o\tpower (x^y) has optimised code for y == 2.\n\n    o\tprcomp() is now generic, with a formula method (based on an\n\tidea of Jari Oksanen).\n\n\tprcomp() now has a simple predict() method.\n\n    o\tprintCoefmat() has a new logical argument 'signif.legend'.\n\n    o\tquantile() has the option of several methods described in\n\tHyndman &amp; Fan (1996). (Contributed by Rob Hyndman.)\n\n    o\trank() has two new 'ties.method's, &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew function read.fortran() reads Fortran-style fixed-format\n\tspecifications.\n\n    o\tread.fwf() reads multiline records, is faster for large files.\n\n    o\tread.table() now accepts &quot;NULL&quot;, &quot;factor&quot;, &quot;Date&quot; and\n\t&quot;POSIXct&quot; as possible values of colClasses, and colClasses can\n\tbe a named character vector.\n\n    o\treadChar() can now read strings with embedded nuls.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;dendrogram&quot; method for reorder() now has a 'agglo.FUN'\n\targument for specification of a weights agglomeration\n\tfunction.\n\n    o\tNew reorder() method for factors, slightly extending that in\n\tlattice.  Contributed by Deepayan Sarkar.\n\n    o\tReplaying a plot (with replayPlot() or via autoprinting) now\n\tautomagically opens a device if none is open.\n\n    o\treplayPlot() issues a warning if an attempt is made to replay\n\ta plot that was recorded using a different R version (the\n\tformat for recorded plots is not guaranteed to be stable\n\tacross different R versions).  The Windows-menu equivalent\n\t(History...Get from variable) issues a similar warning.\n\n    o\treshape() can handle multiple 'id' variables.\n\n    o\tIt is now possible to specify colours with a full alpha\n\ttransparency channel via the new 'alpha' argument to the\n\trgb() and hsv() functions, or as a string of the form &quot;#RRGGBBAA&quot;.\n\n\tNOTE: most devices draw nothing if a colour is not opaque,\n\tbut PDF and Quartz devices will render semitransparent colours.\n\n\tA new argument 'alpha' to the function col2rgb()\n\tprovides the ability to return the alpha component of\n\tcolours (as well as the red, green, and blue components).\n\n    o\tsave() now checks that a binary connection is used.\n\n    o\tseek() on connections now accepts and returns a double for the\n\tfile position.\tThis allows &gt;2Gb files to be handled on a\n\t64-bit platform (and some 32-bit platforms).\n\n    o\tsource() with 'echo = TRUE' uses the function source attribute\n\twhen displaying commands as they are parsed.\n\n    o\tsetClass() and its utilities now warn if either superclasses\n\tor classes for slots are undefined.  (Use setOldClass to\n\tregister S3 classes for use as slots)\n\n    o\tstr(obj) now displays more reasonably the STRucture of S4 objects.\n\n\tIt is also improved for language objects and lists with promise\n\tcomponents.\n\n\tThe method for class &quot;dendrogram&quot; has a new argument 'stem' and\n\tindicates when it's not printing all levels (as typically when\n\te.g., 'max.level = 2').\n\n\tSpecifying 'max.level = 0' now allows to suppress all but the top\n\tlevel for hierarchical objects such as lists. This is different\n\tto previous behavior which was the default behavior of giving all\n\tlevels is unchanged.  The default behavior is unchanged but now\n\tspecified by 'max.level = NA'.\n\n    o\tsystem.time() has a new argument 'gcFirst' which, when TRUE,\n\tforces a garbage collection before timing begins.\n\n    o\ttail() of a matrix now displays the original row numbers.\n\n    o\tThe default method for text() now coerces a factor to character\n\tand not to its internal codes.\tThis is incompatible with S\n\tbut seems what users would expect.\n\n\tIt now also recycles (x,y) to the length of 'labels' if that\n\tis longer.  This is now compatible with grid.text() and\n\tS. (See also PR#7084.)\n\n    o\tTukeyHSD() now labels comparisons when applied to an\n\tinteraction in an aov() fit.  It detects non-factor terms in\n\t'which' and drops them if sensible to do so.\n\n    o\tThere is now a replacement method for window(), to allow a\n\trange of values of time series to be replaced by specifying the\n\tstart and end times (and optionally a frequency).\n\n    o\tIf writeLines() is given a connection that is not open, it now\n\tattempts to open it in mode = &quot;wt&quot; rather than the default\n\tmode specified when creating the connection.\n\n    o\tThe screen devices x11(), windows() and quartz() have a new\n\targument 'bg' to set the default background colour.\n\n\n    o\tSubassignments involving NAs and with a replacement value of\n\tlength &gt; 1 are now disallowed.\t(They were handled\n\tinconsistently in R &lt; 2.0.0, see PR#7210.)  For data frames\n\tthey are disallowed altogether, even for logical matrix indices\n\t(the only case which used to work).\n\n    o\tThe way the comparison operators handle a list argument has\n\tbeen rationalized so a few more cases will now work -- see\n\t?Comparison.\n\n    o\tIndexing a vector by a character vector was slow if both the\n\tvector and index were long (say 10,000).  Now hashing is used\n\tand the time should be linear in the longer of the lengths\n\t(but more memory is used).\n\n    o\tPrinting a character string with embedded nuls now prints the\n\twhole string, and non-printable characters are represented by\n\toctal escape sequences.\n\n    o\tObjects created from a formally defined class now include the\n\tname of the corresponding package as an attribute in the\n\tobject's class.\t This allows packages with namespaces to have\n\tprivate (non-exported) classes.\n\n    o\tChanges to package 'grid':\n\n\t- Calculation of number of circles to draw in circleGrob now\n\t  looks at length of y and r as well as length of x.\n\n\t- Calculation of number of rectangles to draw in rectGrob now\n\t  looks at length of y, w, and h as well as length of x.\n\n\t- All primitives (rectangles, lines, text, ...) now handle\n\t  non-finite values (NA, Inf, -Inf, NaN) for locations and\n\t  sizes.\n\n\t  Non-finite values for locations, sizes, and scales of\n\t  viewports result in error messages.\n\n\t  There is a new vignette (&quot;nonfinite&quot;) which describes this\n\t  new behaviour.\n\n\t- Fixed (unreported) bug in drawing circles.  Now checks that\n\t  radius is non-negative.\n\n\t- downViewport() now reports the depth it went down to find a\n\t  viewport.  Handy for &quot;going back&quot; to where you started, e.g., ...\n\n\t    depth &lt;- downViewport(&quot;vpname&quot;)\n\t    &lt;draw stuff&gt;\n\t    upViewport(depth)\n\n\t- The &quot;alpha&quot; gpar() is now combined with the alpha channel of\n\t  colours when creating a gcontext as follows: (internal C code)\n\n\t    finalAlpha = gpar(&quot;alpha&quot;)*(R_ALPHA(col)/255)\n\n\t  This means that gpar(alpha=) settings now affect internal\n\t  colours so grid alpha transparency settings now are sent to\n\t  graphics devices.\n\n\t  The alpha setting is also cumulative.\t For example, ...\n\n\t    grid.rect(width=0.5, height=0.5,\n\t\t      gp=gpar(fill=&quot;blue&quot;))\t\t # alpha = 1\n\t    pushViewport(viewport(gp=gpar(alpha=0.5)))\n\t    grid.rect(height=0.25, gp=gpar(fill=&quot;red&quot;))\t # alpha = 0.5\n\t    pushViewport(viewport(gp=gpar(alpha=0.5)))\n\t    grid.rect(width=0.25, gp=gpar(fill=&quot;red&quot;))\t # alpha = 0.25 !\n\n\t- Editing a gp slot in a grob is now incremental.  For example ...\n\n\t    grid.lines(name=&quot;line&quot;)\n\t    grid.edit(&quot;line&quot;, gp=gpar(col=&quot;red&quot;)) # line turns red\n\t    grid.edit(&quot;line&quot;, gp=gpar(lwd=3)) # line becomes thick\n\t\t\t\t\t      # AND STAYS red\n\n\t- The &quot;cex&quot; gpar is now cumulative.  For example ...\n\n\t    grid.rect(height=unit(4, &quot;char&quot;)) # cex = 1\n\t    pushViewport(viewport(gp=gpar(cex=0.5)))\n\t    grid.rect(height=unit(4, &quot;char&quot;)) # cex = 0.5\n\t    pushViewport(viewport(gp=gpar(cex=0.5)))\n\t    grid.rect(height=unit(4, &quot;char&quot;)) # cex = 0.125 !!!\n\n\t- New childNames() function to list the names of children\n\t  of a gTree.\n\n\t- The &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;global&quot; arguments have been implemented for\n\t  grid.[add|edit|get|remove]Grob() functions.\n\n\t  The &quot;grep&quot; argument has also been implemented for the\n\t  grid.set() and setGrob().\n\n\t- New function grid.grab() which creates a gTree from the\n\t  current display list (i.e., the current page of output can\n\t  be converted into a single gTree object with all grobs\n\t  on the current page as children of the gTree and all the\n\t  viewports used in drawing the current page in the childrenvp\n\t  slot of the gTree).\n\n\t- New &quot;lineend&quot;, &quot;linejoin&quot;, and &quot;linemitre&quot; gpar()s:\n\n\t  line end can be &quot;round&quot;, &quot;butt&quot;, or &quot;square&quot;.\n\t  line join can be &quot;round&quot;, &quot;mitre&quot;, or &quot;bevel&quot;.\n\t  line mitre can be any number larger than 1\n\t    (controls when a mitre join gets turned into a bevel join;\n\t     proportional to angle between lines at join;\n\t     very big number means that conversion only happens for lines\n\t     that are almost parallel at join).\n\n\t- New grid.prompt() function for controlling whether the user is\n\t  prompted before starting a new page of output.\n\n\t  Grid no longer responds to the par(ask) setting in the &quot;graphics&quot;\n\t  package.\n\n    o\tThe tcltk package has had the tkcmd() function renamed as\n\ttcl() since it could be used to invoke commands that had\n\tnothing to do with Tk. The old name is retained, but will be\n\tdeprecated in a future release. Similarly, we now have\n\ttclopen(), tclclose(), tclread(), tclputs(), tclfile.tail(),\n\tand tclfile.dir() replacing counterparts starting with &quot;tk&quot;,\n\twith old names retained for now.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD check now checks for file names in a directory that\n\tdiffer only by case.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now checks Rd files using R code from package tools,\n\tand gives refined diagnostics about &quot;likely&quot; Rd problems (stray\n\ttop-level text which is silently discarded by Rdconv).\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL now fails for packages with incomplete/invalid\n\tDESCRIPTION metadata, using new code from package tools which is\n\talso used by R CMD check.\n\n    o\tlist_files_with_exts (package tools) now handles zipped directories.\n\n    o\tPackage 'tools' now provides Rd_parse(), a simple top-level\n\tparser/analyzer for R documentation format.\n\n    o\ttools::codoc() (and hence R CMD check) now checks any documentation\n\tfor registered S3 methods and unexported objects in packages\n\twith namespaces.\n\n    o\tPackage 'utils' contains several new functions:\n\n\t- Generics toBibtex() and toLatex() for converting\n\t  R objects to BibTeX and LaTeX (but almost no methods yet).\n\n\t- A much improved citation() function which also has a package\n\t  argument.  By default the citation is auto-generated from\n\t  the package DESCRIPTION, the file 'inst/CITATION' can be\n\t  used to override this, see help(citation) and\n\t  help(citEntry).\n\n\t- sessionInfo() can be used to include version information about\n\t  R and R packages in text or LaTeX documents.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n    o\tThe DVI and PDF manuals are now all made on the paper specified\n\tby R_PAPERSIZE (default 'a4'), even the .texi manuals which\n\twere made on US letter paper in previous versions.\n\n    o\tThe reference manual now omits 'internal' help pages.\n\n    o\tThere is a new help page shown by help(&quot;Memory-limits&quot;) which\n\tdocuments the current design limitations on large objects.\n\n    o\tThe format of the LaTeX version of the documentation has\n\tchanged.  The old format is still accepted, but only the new\n\tresolves cross-references to object names containing _, for\n\texample.\n\n    o\tHTML help pages now contain a reference to the package and\n\tversion in the footer, and HTML package index pages give their\n\tname and version at the top.\n\n    o\tAll manuals in the 2.x series have new ISBN numbers.\n\n    o\tThe 'R Data Import/Export' manual has been revised and has a\n\tnew chapter on `Reading Excel spreadsheets'.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tThe PACKAGE argument for .C/.Call/.Fortran/.External can be\n\tomitted if the call is within code within a package with a\n\tnamespace.  This ensures that the native routine being called\n\tis found in the DLL of the correct version of the package if\n\tmultiple versions of a package are loaded in the R session.\n\tUsing a namespace and omitting the PACKAGE argument is\n\tcurrently the only way to ensure that the correct version is\n\tused.\n\n    o\tThe header Rmath.h contains a definition for R_VERSION_STRING\n\twhich can be used to track different versions of R and libRmath.\n\n    o\tThe Makefile in src/nmath/standalone now has 'install' and\n\t'uninstall' targets -- see the README file in that directory.\n\n    o\tMore of the header files, including Rinternals.h, Rdefines.h and\n\tRversion.h, are now suitable for calling directly from C++.\n\n    o   Configure looks to a suitable option for inlining C code which\n\tmade available as macro R_INLINE: see `Writing R Extensions'\n\tfor further details.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tDirect use of R INSTALL|REMOVE|BATCH|COMPILE|SHLIB has been\n\tremoved: use R CMD instead.\n\n    o\tLa.eigen(), tetragamma(), pentagamma(), package.contents() and\n\tpackage.description() are defunct.\n\n    o\tThe undocumented function newestVersion() is no longer exported\n\tfrom package utils.  (Mainly because it was not completely general.)\n\n    o\tC-level entry point ptr_R_GetX11Image has been removed, as it\n\twas replaced by R_GetX11Image at 1.7.0.\n\n    o\tThe undocumented C-level entry point R_IsNaNorNA has been\n\tremoved.  It was used in a couple of packages, and should be\n\treplaced by a call to the documented macro ISNAN.\n\n    o\tThe gnome/GNOME graphics device is now defunct.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tArithmetic supporting +/-Inf, NaNs and the IEC 60559 (aka\n\tIEEE 754) standard is now required -- the partial and often\n\tuntested support for more limited arithmetic has been removed.\n\n\tThe C99 macro isfinite is used in preference to finite if available\n\t(and its correct functioning is checked at configure time).\n\n\tWhere isfinite or finite is available and works, it is used as\n\tthe substitution value for R_FINITE.  On some platforms this\n\tleads to a performance gain.  (This applies to compiled code\n\tin packages only for isfinite.)\n\n    o\tThe dynamic libraries libR and libRlapack are now installed in\n\tR_HOME/lib rather than R_HOME/bin.\n\n    o\tWhen --enable-R-shlib is specified, the R executable is now a\n\tsmall executable linked against libR: see the R-admin manual\n\tfor further discussion.\t The 'extra' libraries bzip2, pcre,\n\txdr and zlib are now compiled in a way that allows the code to\n\tbe included in a shared library only if this option is\n\tspecified, which might improve performance when it is not.\n\n    o\tThe main R executable is now R_HOME/exec/R not R_HOME/R.bin, to\n\tease issues on MacOS X.\t (The location is needed when debugging\n\tcore dumps, on other platforms.)\n\n    o\tConfigure now tests for 'inline' and alternatives, and the\n\tsrc/extra/bzip2 code now (potentially) uses inlining where\n\tavailable and not just under gcc.\n\n    o\tThe XPG4 sed is used on Solaris for forming dependencies,\n\twhich should now be done correctly.\n\n    o\tMakeinfo 4.5 or later is now required for building the HTML and\n\tInfo versions of the manuals.  However, binary distributions\n\tneed to be made with 4.7 or later to ensure some of the\n\tlinks are correct.\n\n    o\tf2c is not allowed on 64-bit platforms, as it uses longs for\n\tFortran integers.\n\n    o\tThere are new options on how to make the PDF version of the\n\treference manual -- see the 'R Administration and Installation\n\tManual' section 2.2.\n\n    o\tThe concatenated Rd files in the installed 'man' directory are\n\tnow compressed and the R CMD check routines can read the\n\tcompressed files.\n\n    o   There is a new configure option --enable-linux-lfs that will\n\tbuild R with support for &gt; 2Gb files on suitably recent 32-bit\n\tLinux systems.\n\n\nPACKAGE INSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe DESCRIPTION file of packages may contain a 'Imports:'\n\tfield for packages whose namespaces are used but do not need\n\tto be attached.\t Such packages should no longer be listed in\n\t'Depends:'.\n\n    o\tThere are new optional fields 'SaveImage', 'LazyLoad' and\n\t'LazyData' in the DESCRIPTION file.  Using 'SaveImage' is\n\tpreferred to using an empty file 'install.R'.\n\n    o\tA package can contain a file 'R/sysdata.rda' to contain\n\tsystem datasets to be lazy-loaded into the namespace/package\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tThe packages listed in 'Depends' are now loaded before a package\n\tis loaded (or its image is saved or it is prepared for lazy\n\tloading).  This means that almost all uses of R_PROFILE.R and\n\tinstall.R are now unnecessary.\n\n    o\tIf installation of any package in a bundle fails, R CMD\n\tINSTALL will back out the installation of all of the bundle,\n\tnot just the failed package (on both Unix and Windows).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tComplex superassignments were wrong when a variable with the same\n\tname existed locally, and were not documented in R-lang.\n\n    o\trbind.data.frame() dropped names/rownames from columns in all\n\tbut the first data frame.\n\n    o\tThe dimnames&lt;- method for data.frames was not checking the\n\tvalidity of the row names.\n\n    o\tVarious memory leaks reported by valgrind have been plugged.\n\n    o\tgzcon() connections would sometimes read the crc bytes from\n\tthe wrong place, possibly uninitialized memory.\n\n    o\tRd.sty contained a length \\middle that was not needed after a\n\trevision in July 2000.\tIt caused problems with LaTeX systems\n\tbased on e-TeX which are starting to appear.\n\n    o\tsave() to a connection did not check that the connection was\n\topen for writing, nor that non-ascii saves cannot be made to a\n\ttext-mode connection.\n\n    o\tphyper() uses a new algorithm based on Morten Welinder's bug\n\treport (PR#6772).  This leads to faster code for large arguments\n\tand more precise code, e.g. for phyper(59, 150,150, 60,\tlower=FALSE).\n\tThis also fixes bug (PR#7064) about fisher.test().\n\n    o\tprint.default(*, gap = &lt;n&gt;) now in principle accepts all\n\tnon-negative values &lt;n&gt;.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline(...)$pen.crit had a typo in its computation;\n\tnote this was printed in print.smooth.spline(*) but not used in\n\tother &quot;smooth.spline&quot; methods.\n\n    o\twrite.table() handles zero-row and zero-column inputs correctly.\n\n    o\tdebug() works on trivial functions instead of crashing. (PR#6804)\n\n    o\teval() could alter a data.frame/list second argument, so\n\twith(trees, Girth[1] &lt;- NA) altered 'trees' (and any copy of\n\t'trees' too).\n\n    o\tcor() could corrupt memory when the standard deviation was\n\tzero. (PR#7037)\n\n    o\tinverse.gaussian() always printed 1/mu^2 as the link function.\n\n    o\tconstrOptim() now passes ... arguments through optim to the\n\tobjective function.\n\n    o\tobject.size() now has a better estimate for character vectors:\n\tit was in general too low (but only significantly so for\n\tvery short character strings) but over-estimated NA and\n\tduplicated elements.\n\n    o\tquantile() now interpolates correctly between finite and\n\tinfinite values (giving +/-Inf rather than NaN).\n\n    o\tlibrary() now gives more informative error messages mentioning\n\tthe package being loaded.\n\n    o\tBuilding the reference manual no longer uses roman upright\n\tquotes in typewriter output.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() no longer builds invalid data frames if the\n\tdata contains time series and rows are omitted by na.action.\n\n    o\twrite.table() did not escape quotes in column names.  (PR#7171)\n\n    o\tRange checks missing in recursive assignments using [[ ]].  (PR#7196)\n\n    o\tpackageStatus() reported partially-installed bundles as\n\tinstalled.\n\n    o\tapply() failed on an array of dimension &gt;=3 when for each\n\titeration the function returns a named vector of length &gt;=2.\n\t(PR#7205)\n\n    o\tThe GNOME interface was in some circumstances failing if run\n\tfrom a menu -- it needed to always specify that R be interactive.\n\n    o\tdepMtrxToStrings (part of pkgDepends) applied nrow() to a\n\tnon-matrix and aborted on the result.\n\n    o\tFix some issues with nonsyntactical names in modelling code\n\t(PR#7202), relating to backquoting.  There are likely more.\n\n    o\tSupport for S4 classes that extend basic classes has been fixed\n\tin several ways.  as() methods and <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">x at .Data</A> should work better.\n\n    o\thist() and pretty() accept (and ignore) infinite values.

(PR#7225)\n\n    o\tmle() had problems if ndeps or parscale was supplied in the\n\tcontrol arguments for optim().  Also, the profiler is now more\n\tcareful to reevaluate modified mle() calls in its parent\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tFix to rendering of accented superscripts and subscripts e.g.,\n\texpression((b[dot(a)])).  (Patch from Uwe Ligges.)\n\n    o\tattach(*, pos=1) now gives a warning (and will give an error).\n\n    o\tpower.*test() now gives an error when 'sig.level' is outside [0,1].\n\t(PR#7245)\n\n    o\tFitting a binomial glm with a matrix response lost the names of\n\tthe response, which should have been transferred to the\n\tresiduals and fitted values.\n\n    o   print.ts() could get the year wrong because rounding issue\n        (PR#7255)\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

(Also fixes PR#6776.)\n\n    o\tnls() now looks for variables and functions in its formula in\n\tthe environment of the formula before the search path, in the\n\tsame way lm() etc look for variables in their formulae.\n\n\nINSTALLATION ISSUES\n\n    o\tsrc/modules/X11/dataentry.c would not build on some XFree\n\t4.4.0 systems.\t(This is a bug in their header files but we have\n\tadded a workaround.)\n\n    o\tBuilding with gcc/g77 3.4.0 on ix86 platforms failed to produce\n\ta working build: the critical LAPACK routines are now compiled\n\twith -ffloat-store.\n\n    o\tAdded patches to enable 64-bit builds on AIX 5.1: see the R-admin\n\tmanual for details.\n\n    o\tAdded some patches to allow non-IEEE-754 installations to work\n\treasonably well.  (Infs and NAs are still not handled properly\n\tin complex arithmetic and functions such as sin().  See also\n\tDeprecated, as support for non-IEEE-754 installations is about\n\tto be removed.)\n\n    o\tInstallation will now work in Estonian (et_EE*) locales, which\n\tsort z before u.  (PR#6958)\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tSupport for non-IEEE-754 arithmetic (which has been untested\n\tfor some time) will be removed in the next full release.\n\n    o\tDirect use of R INSTALL|REMOVE|BATCH|COMPILE|SHLIB is\n\tdeprecated: use R CMD instead.\n\n    o\tThe gnome/GNOME graphics device is deprecated and will be\n\tremoved in the next full release.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tpbinom(q, N, prob) is now more accurate when prob is close to 0.\n\t(PR#6757)\n\n    o\tpcauchy(x, .., log.p) is now more accurate for large x,\n\tparticularly when log.p = TRUE. (PR#6756)\n\n    o\tpgeom(q, prob, lower.tail, log.p) is now (sometimes much) more\n\taccurate when prob is very small. (PR#6792)\n\n\tThe code for pgeom(prob=1) assumed IEEE 754 arithmetic, and\n\tgave NaNs under gcc 3.4.0 -fPIC, for example.\n\n    o\tmakeARIMA() was not handling an ARMA(0, 0) model correctly.\n\n    o\tas.Date() was failing on factors.  (PR#6779)\n\n    o\tmin(), max() and range() were failing on &quot;difftime&quot; objects.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame.list() could fail on some unusual list names.\n\t(PR#6782)\n\n    o\ttype.convert() ignored na.strings when no conversion was done.\n\t(PR#6781, not needed for its primary use in read.table.)\n\n    o\tFixed a clipping problem in the quartz() device.\n\n    o\tSubsetting a factor swapped the order of the attributes, which\n\tidentical() cares about.  (PR#6799)\n\n    o\tThe L-BFGS-B option of optim() apparently needs part of its\n\tworkspace zeroed.  (PR#6720)\n\n    o\textractAIC.survreg() needed updating.\n\n    o\tWhen using the header Rmath.h in standalone mode, the case where\n\tTRUE, FALSE are already defined is now handled correctly.\n\n    o\tPackage utils now exports several functions that are needed for\n\twriting Sweave drivers.\n\n    o\tComparison of two lists/expressions was giving nonsensical\n\t(and often random) answers, and is now an error.\n\n    o\tThe C-level function ncols was returning a random answer\n\t(often 0) for a 1D array.  This caused model.matrix to\n\tmisbehave (perhaps segfault) if a term was a 1D array.\t(PR#6838)\n\n    o\tThe configure script now finds the pdf viewers ggv and gpdf.\n\n    o\tWorkaround for the problems strptime on MacOS X has with dates\n\tbefore 1900.\n\n    o\t'R CMD build' works in a directory whose path contains spaces.\n\t(PR#6830 under Unix/Linux: it already worked under Windows.)\n\tAlso 'R CMD check'.\n\n    o\tmosaicplot() stops cleanly if given a table containing missing values.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() from a local CRAN was broken.\n\n    o\tbxp() fixed for e.g.,  boxplot(..., border=2:4)\n\n    o\tapprox(list(x=rep(NaN,9), y=1:9), xout=NaN) does not seg.fault\n\tanymore (PR#6809).\n\n    o\tplot(1, pch=NA) does not give an error anymore and\n\tplot(1:2, pch=c(&quot;o&quot;,NA)) only prints one symbol\t (PR#6876).\n\n    o\tdiffinv(matrix(3, 7,0)) now works.\n\n    o\tplot.ts(z) for multivariate 'z' now properly draws all 'nc' xlab`s\n\twhen nc &gt; 1 and obeys 'ann=FALSE' or 'axes=FALSE'.\n\n    o\taggregate(.data.frame) failed if the answer would have had one\n\trow.\n\n    o\trecordPlot() and replayPlot() failed to duplicate the display\n\tlist, so further plotting altered the saved or replayed object.\n\n    o\tAssignments of the form adf[i,j] &lt;- value now accept a\n\tdata-frame value as well as a list value.\n\n    o\tdir.create() sometimes erroneously continued to report a directory\n\talready existed after the first instance.  (PR#6892)\n\n    o\tarima.sim() allows a null model.\n\n    o\twhich.min() &amp; which.max()'s C code now PROTECT()'s its result.\n\n    o\tBuilding standalone nmath did not support some of the DEBUG options.\n\n    o   mle() got confused if start value list was not in same order as\n        arguments of likelihood function (reported by Ben Bolker)\n\n    o\tbacksolve(r, x, k) now allows k &lt; nrow(x) - as its documentation\n\talways claimed.\n\n    o\tupdate.packages(&quot;mgcv&quot;) and old.packages(*) now give a better error\n\tmessage; and installed.packages(&quot;mgcv&quot;) properly returns &lt;empty&gt;.\n\n    o\tstats:::as.dendrogram.hclust() is documented and no longer re-sorts\n\tthe two children at each node.\tThis fixes as.dendrogram(hh) for\n\tthe case where hh is a &quot;reordered&quot; hclust object.\n\n\tplot.dendrogram(x) now draws leaves 'x' more sensibly.\n\n\treorder.dendrogram() now results in a dendrogram with correct\n\t&quot;midpoint&quot;s, and hence reordered dendrograms are plotted correctly.\n\n\tstats:::midcache.dendrogram() and hence the reorder() and rev()\n\tdendrogram methods do not return bloated dendrograms.\n\n    o\theatmap(*, labRow=., labCol=.) now also reorders the labels when\n\tspecified---not only when using default labels.\n\n    o   Copying lattice (grid) output to another device now works again\n        (There were intermittent problems in 1.9.0 - PR#6915, #6947/8.)\n\n    o\thist() uses a more robust choice of its 'diddle' factor, used\n\tto detect if an observation is on a bin boundary.  (PR#6931)\n\n    o\tjitter(x) now returns x when length(x) == 0.\n\n    o\tUnder some rare circumstances the locale-specific tables used by\n\tthe perl=TRUE option to grep() etc were being corrupted and so\n\tmatches were missed.\n\n    o\tqbinom(*, prob = 0, lower.tail = FALSE) now properly gives 0.\n\t(PR#6972)\n\n    o\tClass &quot;octmode&quot; needed a &quot;[&quot; method to preserve the class: see\n\texample(file.info) for an example.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

Very old code\n\tthat makes use of underscore for assignment may now give\n\tconfusing error messages.\n\n    o\tPackage 'base' has been split into packages 'base', 'graphics',\n\t'stats' and 'utils'.  All four are loaded in a default\n\tinstallation, but the separation allows a 'lean and mean'\n\tversion of R to be used for tasks such as building indices.\n\n\tPackages ctest, eda, modreg, mva, nls, stepfun and ts have been\n\tmerged into stats, and lqs has been returned to MASS.  In all\n\tcases a stub has been left that will issue a warning and ensure\n\tthat the appropriate new home is loaded.  All the time series\n\tdatasets have been moved to package stats.  Sweave has been\n\tmoved to utils.\n\n\tPackage mle has been moved to stats4 which will become the\n\tcentral place for statistical S4 classes and methods\n\tdistributed with base R.  Package mle remains as a stub.\n\n\tUsers may notice that code in .Rprofile is run with only the\n\tnew base loaded and so functions may now not be found.\tFor\n\texample, ps.options(horizontal = TRUE) should be preceded by\n\tlibrary(graphics) or called as graphics::ps.options or,\n\tbetter, set as a hook -- see ?setHook.\n\n    o\tThere has been a concerted effort to speed up the startup of\n\tan R session: it now takes about 2/3rds of the time of 1.8.1.\n\n    o\tA warning is issued at startup in a UTF-8 locale, as currently R\n\tonly supports single-byte encodings.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\t$, $&lt;-, [[, [[&lt;- can be applied to environments. Only character\n\targuments are allowed and no partial matching is done.\tThe\n\tsemantics are basically that of get/assign to the environment with\n\tinherits=FALSE.\n\n    o\tThere are now print() and [ methods for &quot;acf&quot; objects.\n\n    o\taov() will now handle singular Error() models, with a warning.\n\n    o\tarima() allows models with no free parameters to be fitted (to\n\tfind log-likelihood and AIC values, thanks to Rob Hyndman).\n\n    o\tarray() and matrix() now allow 0-length `data' arguments for\n\tcompatibility with S.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame() now has a method for arrays.\n\n    o\tas.matrix.data.frame() now coerces an all-logical data frame\n\tto a logical matrix.\n\n    o\tNew function assignInNamespace() parallelling fixInNamespace.\n\n    o\tThere is a new function contourLines() to produce contour\n\tlines (but not draw anything).\tThis makes the CRAN package\n\tclines (with its clines() function) redundant.\n\n    o\tD(), deriv(), etc now also differentiate asin(), acos(), atan(),\n\t(thanks to a contribution of Kasper Kristensen).\n\n    o\tThe `package' argument to data() is no longer allowed to be a\n\t(unquoted) name and so can be a variable name or a quoted\n\tcharacter string.\n\n    o\tThere is a new class &quot;Date&quot; to represent dates (without times)\n\tplus many utility functions similar to those for date-times.\n\tSee ?Date.\n\n    o\tDeparsing (including using dump() and dput()) an integer\n\tvector now wraps it in as.integer() so it will be source()d\n\tcorrectly.  (Related to PR#4361.)\n\n    o\t.Deprecated() has a new argument `package' which is used in\n\tthe warning message for non-base packages.\n\n    o\tThe print() method for &quot;difftime&quot; objects now handles arrays.\n\n    o\tdir.create() is now an internal function (rather than a call to\n\tmkdir) on Unix as well as on Windows.  There is now an option\n\tto suppress warnings from mkdir, which may or may not have\n\tbeen wanted.\n\n    o\tdist() has a new method to calculate Minkowski distances.\n\n    o\texpand.grid() returns appropriate array dimensions and dimnames\n\tin the attribute &quot;out.attrs&quot;, and this is used by the\n\tpredict() method for loess to return a suitable array.\n\n    o\tfactanal(), loess() and princomp() now explicitly check for\n\tnumerical inputs; they might have silently coded factor\n\tvariables in formulae.\n\n    o\tNew functions factorial(x) defined as gamma(x+1) and for\n\tS-PLUS compatibility, lfactorial(x) defined as lgamma(x+1).\n\n    o\tfindInterval(x, v) now allows +/-Inf values, and NAs in x.\n\n    o\tformula.default() now looks for a &quot;terms&quot; component before a\n\t'formula' argument in the saved call: the component will have\n\t`.' expanded and probably will have the original environment\n\tset as its environment.\t And what it does is now documented.\n\n    o\tglm() arguments `etastart' and `mustart' are now evaluated via\n\tthe model frame in the same way as `subset' and `weights'.\n\n    o\tFunctions grep(), regexpr(), sub() and gsub() now coerce their\n\targuments to character, rather than give an error.\n\n\tThe perl=TRUE argument now uses character tables prepared for\n\tthe locale currently in use each time it is used, rather than\n\tthose of the C locale.\n\n    o\tNew functions head() and tail() in package `utils'.\n\t(Based on a contribution by Patrick Burns.)\n\n    o\tlegend() has a new argument 'text.col'.\n\n    o\tmethods(class=) now checks for a matching generic, and so no\n\tlonger returns methods for non-visible generics (and\n\teliminates various mismatches).\n\n    o\tA new function mget() will retrieve multiple values from an\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() methods, for example those for &quot;lm&quot; and &quot;glm&quot;,\n\tpass relevant parts of ... onto the default method.  (This has\n\tlong been documented but not done.)  The default method is now\n\table to cope with model classes such as &quot;lqs&quot; and &quot;ppr&quot;.\n\n    o\tnls() and ppr() have a `model' argument to allow the model frame\n\tto be returned as part of the fitted object.\n\n    o\t&quot;POSIXct&quot; objects can now have a &quot;tzone&quot; attribute that\n\tdetermines how they will be converted and printed.  This means\n\tthat date-time objects which have a timezone specified will\n\tgenerally be regarded as in their original time zone.\n\n    o\tpostscript() device output has been modified to work around\n\trounding errors in low-precision calculations in gs &gt;= 8.11.\n\t(PR#5285, which is not a bug in R.)\n\n\tIt is now documented how to use other Computer Modern fonts,\n\tfor example italic rather than slanted.\n\n    o\tppr() now fully supports categorical explanatory variables,\n\n\tppr() is now interruptible at suitable places in the\n\tunderlying FORTRAN code.\n\n    o\tprincomp() now warns if both `x' and `covmat' are supplied,\n\tand returns scores only if the centring used is known.\n\n    o\tpsigamma(x, deriv=0), a new function generalizes, digamma() etc.\n\tAll these (psigamma, digamma, trigamma,...) now also work for  x &lt; 0.\n\n    o\tpchisq(*, ncp &gt; 0) and hence qchisq() now work with much higher\n\tvalues of ncp; it has become much more accurate in the left tail.\n\n    o\tread.table() now allows embedded newlines in quoted fields. (PR#4555)\n\n    o\trep.default(0-length-vector, length.out=n) now gives a vector\n\tof length n and not length 0, for compatibility with S.\n\n\tIf both `each' and `length.out' have been specified, it now\n\trecycles rather than fills with NAs for S compatibility.\n\n\tIf both `times' and `length.out' have been specified, `times'\n\tis now ignored for S compatibility.  (Previously padding with\n\tNAs was used.)\n\n\tThe &quot;POSIXct&quot; and &quot;POSIXlt&quot; methods for rep() now pass ... on\n\tto the default method (as expected by PR#5818).\n\n    o\trgb2hsv() is new, an R interface the C API function with the same name.\n\n    o\tUser hooks can be set for onLoad, library, detach and\n\tonUnload of packages/namespaces: see ?setHook.\n\n    o\tsave() default arguments can now be set using option\n\t&quot;save.defaults&quot;, which is also used by save.image() if option\n\t&quot;save.image.defaults&quot; is not present.\n\n    o\tNew function shQuote() to quote strings to be passed to OS shells.\n\n    o\tsink() now has a split= argument to direct output to both the\n\tsink and the current output connection.\n\n    o\tsplit.screen() now works for multiple devices at once.\n\n    o\tOn some OSes (including Windows and those using glibc)\n\tstrptime() did not validate dates correctly, so we have added\n\textra code to do so.  However, this cannot correct scanning\n\terrors in the OS's strptime (although we have been able to\n\twork around these on Windows).\tSome examples are now tested for\n\tduring configuration.\n\n    o\tstrsplit() now has `fixed' and `perl' arguments and\n\tsplit=&quot;&quot; is optimized.\n\n    o\tsubset() now allows a `drop' argument to remove unused factor\n\tlevels.\t The default is still to keep them.\n\n    o\ttermplot() has an option to smooth the partial residuals.\n\n    o\tvarimax() and promax() add class &quot;loadings&quot; to their loadings\n\tcomponent.\n\n\n    o\tModel fits now add a &quot;dataClasses&quot; attribute to the terms, which\n\tcan be used to check that the variables supplied for\n\tprediction are of the same type as those used for fitting.\n\t(It is currently used by predict() methods for classes &quot;lm&quot;,\n\t&quot;mlm&quot;, &quot;glm&quot; and &quot;ppr&quot;, as well as methods in packages MASS,\n\trpart and tree.)\n\n    o\tNew command-line argument --max-ppsize allows the size of the\n\tpointer protection stack to be set higher than the previous\n\tlimit of 10000.\n\n    o\tThe fonts on an X11() device (also jpeg() and png() on Unix)\n\tcan be specified by a new argument `fonts' defaulting to the\n\tvalue of a new option &quot;X11fonts&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew functions in the tools package: pkgDepends, getDepList and\n\tinstallFoundDepends.  These provide functionality for assessing\n\tdependencies and the availability of them (either locally or\n\tfrom on-line repositories).\n\n    o\tThe parsed contents of a NAMESPACE file are now stored at\n\tinstallation and if available used to speed loading the\n\tpackage, so packages with namespaces should be reinstalled.\n\n    o\tArgument `asp' although not a graphics parameter is accepted\n\tin the ... of graphics functions without a warning.  It now\n\tworks as expected in contour().\n\n    o\tPackage stats4 exports S4 generics for AIC() and BIC().\n\n    o\tThe Mac OS X version now produces an R framework for easier linking\n\tof R into other programs.  As a result, R.app is now relocatable.\n\n    o\tAdded experimental support for conditionals in NAMESPACE files.\n\n    o\tAdded as.list.environment to coerce environments to lists\n\t(efficiently).\n\n    o\tNew function addmargins() in the stats package to add marginal\n\tsummaries to tables, e.g. row and column totals.  (Based on a\n\tcontribution by Bendix Carstensen.)\n\n    o\tdendrogam edge and node labels can now be expressions (to be\n\tplotted via stats:::plotNode called from plot.dendrogram).\n\tThe diamond frames around edge labels are more nicely scaled\n\thorizontally.\n\n    o\tMethods defined in the methods package can now include\n\tdefault expressions for arguments.  If these arguments are\n\tmissing in the call, the defaults in the selected method will\n\toverride a default in the generic.  See ?setMethod.\n\n    o\tChanges to package 'grid':\n\n\t- Renamed push/pop.viewport() to push/popViewport().\n\n\t- Added upViewport(), downViewport(), and seekViewport() to\n\t  allow creation and navigation of viewport tree\n\t  (rather than just viewport stack).\n\n\t- Added id and id.lengths arguments to grid.polygon() to allow\n\t  multiple polygons within single grid.polygon() call.\n\n\t- Added vpList(), vpStack(), vpTree(), and current.vpTree()\n\t  to allow creation of viewport &quot;bundles&quot; that may be pushed\n\t  at once (lists are pushed in parallel, stacks in series).\n\n\t  current.vpTree() returns the current viewport tree.\n\n\t- Added vpPath() to allow specification of viewport path\n\t  in downViewport() and seekViewport().\n\n\t  See ?viewports for an example of its use.\n\n\t  NOTE: it is also possible to specify a path directly,\n\t  e.g., something like &quot;vp1::vp2&quot;, but this is only\n\t  advised for interactive use (in case I decide to change the\n\t  separator :: in later versions).\n\n\t- Added &quot;just&quot; argument to grid.layout() to allow justification\n\t  of layout relative to parent viewport *IF* the layout is not\n\t  the same size as the viewport.  There's an example in\n\t  help(grid.layout).\n\n\t- Allowed the &quot;vp&quot; slot in a grob to be a viewport name or a\n\t  vpPath.  The interpretation of these new alternatives is to\n\t  call downViewport() with the name or vpPath before drawing the\n\t  grob and upViewport() the appropriate amount after drawing the\n\t  grob.\t Here's an example of the possible usage:\n\n\t      pushViewport(viewport(w=.5, h=.5, name=&quot;A&quot;))\n\t      grid.rect()\n\t      pushViewport(viewport(w=.5, h=.5, name=&quot;B&quot;))\n\t      grid.rect(gp=gpar(col=&quot;grey&quot;))\n\t      upViewport(2)\n\t      grid.rect(vp=&quot;A&quot;, gp=gpar(fill=&quot;red&quot;))\n\t      grid.rect(vp=vpPath(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), gp=gpar(fill=&quot;blue&quot;))\n\n\t- Added engine.display.list() function.\t This allows the user to\n\t  tell grid NOT to use the graphics engine display list and to handle\n\t  ALL redraws using its own display list (including redraws after\n\t  device resizes and copies).\n\n\t  This provides a way to avoid some of the problems with resizing\n\t  a device when you have used grid.convert(), or the gridBase package,\n\t  or even base functions such as legend().\n\n\t  There is a document discussing the use of display lists in grid\n\t  on the grid web site\n\t  (<A HREF=\"http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html\">http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html</A>)\n\n\t- Changed the implementation of grob objects.  They are no longer\n\t  implemented as external references.  They are now regular R objects\n\t  which copy-by-value.\tThis means that they can be saved/loaded\n\t  like normal R objects.  In order to retain some existing grob\n\t  behaviour, the following changes were necessary:\n\n\t  + grobs all now have a &quot;name&quot; slot.  The grob name is used to\n\t    uniquely identify a &quot;drawn&quot; grob (i.e., a grob on the display\n\t    list).\n\t  + grid.edit() and grid.pack() now take a grob name as the first\n\t    argument instead of a grob.\t (Actually, they take a gPath -\n\t    see below)\n\t  + the &quot;grobwidth&quot; and &quot;grobheight&quot; units take either a grob\n\t    OR a grob name (actually a gPath - see below).  Only in the\n\t    latter case will the unit be updated if the grob &quot;pointed to&quot;\n\t    is modified.\n\n\t  In addition, the following features are now possible with grobs:\n\n\t  + grobs now save()/load() like any normal R object.\n\t  + many grid.*() functions now have a *Grob() counterpart.  The\n\t    grid.*() version is used for its side-effect of drawing\n\t    something or modifying something which has been drawn;  the\n\t    *Grob() version is used for its return value, which is a grob.\n\t    This makes it more convenient to just work with grob\n\t    objects without producing any graphical output\n\t    (by using the *Grob() functions).\n\t  + there is a gTree object (derived from grob), which is a grob\n\t    that can have children.  A gTree also has a &quot;childrenvp&quot; slot\n\t    which is a viewport which is pushed and then &quot;up&quot;ed before the\n\t    children are drawn;\t this allows the children of a gTree to\n\t    place themselves somewhere in the viewports specified in the\n\t    childrenvp by having a vpPath in their vp slot.\n\t  + there is a gPath object, which is essentially a concatenation\n\t    of grob names.  This is used to specify the child of\n\t    (a child of ...) a gTree.\n\t  + there is a new API for creating/accessing/modifying grob objects:\n\t    grid.add(), grid.remove(), grid.edit(), grid.get() (and their\n\t    *Grob() counterparts can be used to add, remove, edit, or extract\n\t    a grob or the child of a gTree.  NOTE: the new grid.edit() API\n\t    is incompatible with the previous version.\n\n\t- Added stringWidth(), stringHeight(), grobWidth(), and grobHeight()\n\t  convenience functions (they produce &quot;strwidth&quot;, &quot;strheight&quot;,\n\t  &quot;grobwidth&quot;, and &quot;grobheight&quot; unit objects, respectively).\n\n\t- Allowed viewports to turn off clipping altogether.\n\t  Possible settings for viewport clip arg are now:\n\n\t    &quot;on&quot;      = clip to the viewport (was TRUE)\n\t    &quot;inherit&quot; = clip to whatever parent says (was FALSE)\n\t    &quot;off&quot;     = turn off clipping\n\n\t  Still accept logical values (and NA maps to &quot;off&quot;)\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD check  now runs the (Rd) examples with default RNGkind\n\t(uniform &amp; normal) and set.seed(1).\n\texample(*, setRNG = TRUE) does the same.\n\n    o\tundoc() in package `tools' has a new default of `use.values =\n\tNULL' which produces a warning whenever the default values of\n\tfunction arguments differ between documentation and code.\n\tNote that this affects &quot;R CMD check&quot; as well.\n\n    o\tTesting examples via massage-examples.pl (as used by R CMD\n\tcheck) now restores the search path after every help file.\n\n    o\tcheckS3methods() in package 'tools' now also looks for generics\n\tin the loaded namespaces/packages listed in the Depends fields\n\tof the package's DESCRIPTION file when testing an installed\n\tpackage.\n\n    o\tThe DESCRIPTION file of packages may contain a 'Suggests:'\n\tfield for packages that are only used in examples or\n\tvignettes.\n\n    o\tAdded an option to package.dependencies() to handle the\n\t'Suggests' levels of dependencies.\n\n    o\tVignette dependencies can now be checked and obtained via\n\tvignetteDepends.\n\n    o\tOption 'repositories' to list URLs for package repositories\n\tadded.\n\n    o\tpackage.description() has been replaced by packageDescription().\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL/build now skip Subversion's .svn directories as\n\twell as CVS directories.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tarraySubscript and vectorSubscript take a new argument which\n\tis a function pointer that provides access to character\n\tstrings (such as the names vector) rather than assuming these\n\tare passed in.\n\n    o\tR_CheckUserInterrupt is now described in `Writing R Extensions'\n\tand there is a new equivalent subroutine rchkusr for calling\n\tfrom FORTRAN code.\n\n    o\thsv2rgb and rgb2hsv are newly in the C API.\n\n    o\tSalloc and Srealloc are provided in S.h as wrappers for S_alloc\n\tand S_realloc, since current S versions use these forms.\n\n    o\tThe type used for vector lengths is now R_len_t rather than\n\tint, to allow for a future change.\n\n    o\tThe internal header nmath/dpq.h has slightly improved macros\n\tR_DT_val() and R_DT_Cval(), a new R_D_LExp() and improved\n\tR_DT_log() and R_DT_Clog();  this improves accuracy in several\n\t[dpq]-functions {for &quot;extreme&quot; arguments}.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tprint.coefmat() is defunct, replaced by printCoefmat().\n\n    o\tcodes() and codes&lt;-() are defunct.\n\n    o\tanovalist.lm (replaced in 1.2.0) is now defunct.\n\n    o\tglm.fit.null(), lm.fit.null() and lm.wfit.null() are defunct.\n\n    o\tprint.atomic() is defunct.\n\n    o\tThe command-line arguments --nsize and --vsize are no longer\n\trecognized as synonyms for --min-nsize and --min-vsize (which\n\treplaced them in 1.2.0).\n\n    o\tUnnecessary methods coef.{g}lm and fitted.{g}lm have been\n\tremoved: they were each identical to the default method.\n\n    o\tLa.eigen() is deprecated now eigen() uses LAPACK by default.\n\n    o\ttetragamma() and pentagamma() are deprecated, since they are\n\tequivalent to psigamma(, deriv=2) and psigamma(, deriv=3).\n\n    o\tLTRUE/LFALSE in Rmath.h have been removed: they were\n\tdeprecated in 1.2.0.\n\n    o\tpackage.contents() has been deprecated.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe defaults for configure are now --without-zlib\n\t--without-bzlib --without-pcre.\n\n\tThe included PCRE sources have been updated to version 4.5 and\n\tPCRE &gt;= 4.0 is now required if --with-pcre is used.\n\n\tThe included zlib sources have been updated to 1.2.1, and this\n\tis now required if --with-zlib is used.\n\n    o\tconfigure no longer lists bzip2 and PCRE as `additional\n\tcapabilities' as all builds of R have had them since 1.7.0.\n\n    o\t--with-blas=goto to use K. Goto's optimized BLAS will now work.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tWhen lm.{w}fit() disregarded arguments in ... they reported\n\tthe values and not the names.\n\n    o\tlm(singular.ok = FALSE) was looking for 0 rank, not rank &lt; p.\n\n    o\tThe substitution code for strptime in the sources no longer\n\tfollows glibc in silently `correcting' invalid inputs.\n\n    o\tThe cor() function did not remove missing values in the\n\tnon-Pearson case.\n\n    o\t[l]choose() use a more accurate formula which also slightly\n\timproves p- and qhyper(); choose(n, k) now returns 0 instead\n\tof NaN for k &lt; 0 or &gt; n.\n\n    o\tfind(simple.words=TRUE) (the default) was still using regular\n\texpressions for e.g. &quot;+&quot; and &quot;*&quot;.  Also, it checked the mode\n\tonly of the first object matching a regular expression found\n\tin a package.\n\n    o\tMemory leaks in [dpq]wilcox and [dqr]signrank have been plugged.\n\tThese only occurred when multiple values of m or n &gt; 50 were\n\tused in a single call. (PR#5314, plus another potential leak.)\n\n    o\tNon-finite input values to eigen(), La.eigen(), svd() and\n\tLa.svd() are now errors: they often caused infinite\n\tlooping.  (PR#5406, PR#4366, PR#3723: the fix for 3723/4366\n\treturned a vector of NAs, not a matrix, for the eigenvectors.)\n\n    o\tstepfun(x,y) now gives an error when `x' has length 0 instead\n\tof an invalid result (that could lead to a segmentation\n\tfault).\n\n    o\tbuildVignettes() uses file.remove() instead of unlink() to\n\tremove temporary files.\n\n    o\tmethods(class = &quot;lqs&quot;) does not produce extraneous entries anymore.\n\n    o\tDirectly calling a method that uses NextMethod() no longer\n\tproduces the erroneous error message 'function is not a\n\tclosure'.\n\n    o\tchisq.test(x, simulate.p.value = TRUE) could hang in an infinite\n\tloop or segfault, as r2dtable() did, when the entries in x where\n\tlarge. (PR#5701)\n\n    o\tfisher.test(x) could give a P-value of 'Inf' in similar cases which\n\tnow result in an error (PR#4688).  It silently truncated\n\tnon-integer 'x' instead of rounding.\n\n    o\tcutree(a, h=h) silently gave wrong results when 'a' was an\n\tagnes object; now gives an error and reminds of as.hclust().\n\n    o\tpostscript() could crash if given a font value outside the\n\tvalid range 1...5.\n\n    o\tqchisq(1-e, .., ncp=.) did not terminate for small e.\n\t(PR#6421 (PR#875))\n\n    o\tcontrasts() turns a logical variable into a factor.  This now\n\talways has levels c(&quot;FALSE&quot;, &quot;TRUE&quot;) even if only one (or\n\tnone) of these occur in the variable.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame()'s lm and glm methods had 'data' and 'na.action'\n\targuments which they ignored and have been removed.\n\n    o\tThe defaults data=list() in lm() and glm() could never be\n\tused and have been removed.  glm had na.action=na.fail, again\n\tnever used.\n\n    o\ttools:::.getInternalS3generics() was omitting all the members\n\tof the S3 group generics, which also accept methods for members.\n\n    o\tSome BLASes were returning NA %*% 0 as 0 and some as NA.  Now\n\tslower but more careful code is used if NAs are present. (PR#4582)\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() no longer generates invalid filenames for\n\tcode and help files.  Also, care is taken not to generate\n\tfilenames that differ only by case.\n\n    o\tpairs() now respects axis graphical parameters such as\n\tcex.main, font.main and las.\n\n    o\tSaving images of packages with namespaces (such as mle) was\n\tnot compressing the image.\n\n    o\tWhen formula.default() returned a terms object, it returned a\n\tresult of class c(&quot;terms&quot;, &quot;formula&quot;) with different\n\tsubsetting rules from an object of class &quot;formula&quot;.\n\n    o\tThe standalone Rmath library did not build correctly on systems\n\twith inaccurate log1p.\n\n    o\tSpecifying asp is now respected in calls like plot(1, 10, asp=1)\n\twith zero range on both axes.\n\n    o\touter() called rep() with an argument the generic does not\n\thave, and discarded the class of the answer.\n\n    o\tobject.size() now returns a real (not integer) answer and so\n\tcan cope with objects occupying more than 2Gb.\n\n    o\tLookups base:: and ::: were not confining their search to the\n\tnamed package/namespace.\n\n    o\tqbinom() was returning NaN for prob = 0 or 1 or size = 0 even\n\tthough the result is well-defined.  (In part, PR#5900.)\n\n    o\tpar(mgp)[2] was being interpreted as relative to par(mgp)[3].\n\t(PR#6045)\n\n    o\tVersioned install was broken both with and without namespaces:\n\tno R code was loaded.\n\n    o\tmethods(), getS3method() and the registration of S3 methods in\n\tnamespaces were broken if the S3 generic was converted into an\n\tS4 generic by setting an S4 method.\n\n    o\tTitle and copyright holder of the reference manual are now in\n\tsync with the citation() command.\n\n    o\tThe validation code for POSIXlt dates and hence\n\tseq(, by=&quot;DSTdays&quot;) now works for large mday values (not\n\tjust those in -1000...1000).  (PR#6212)\n\n    o\tThe print() method for data frames now copes with data frames\n\tcontaining arrays (other than matrices).\n\n    o\ttexi2dvi() and buildVignettes() use clean=FALSE as default\n\tbecause the option is not supported on some Solaris\n\tmachines. For buildVignettes() this makes no difference as it\n\tuses an internal cleanup mechanism.\n\n    o\tThe biplot() method for &quot;prcomp&quot; was not registered nor exported.\n\t(PR#6425)\n\n    o\tLatex conversion of .Rd files was missing newline before\n\t\\end{Section} etc which occasionally gave problems, as fixed for\n\tsome other \\end{Foo} in 1.8.1.\t(PR#5645)\n\n    o\tWork around a glibc bug to make the %Z format usable in strftime().\n\n    o\tThe glm method for rstandard() was wrongly scaled for cases where\n\tsummary(model)$dispersion != 1.\n\n    o\tCalling princomp() with a covariance matrix (rather than a\n\tlist) failed to predict scores rather than predict NA as\n\tintended.  (PR#6452)\n\n    o\ttermplot() is more tolerant of variables not in the data= argument.\n\t(PR#6327)\n\n    o\tisoreg() could segfault on monotone input sequences.  (PR#6494)\n\n    o\tRdconv detected \\link{\\url{}} only very slowly.\t (PR#6496)\n\n    o\taov() with Error() term and no intercept incorrectly assigned\n\tterms to strata. (PR#6510)\n\n    o\tftable() incorrectly handled arguments named &quot;x&quot;.  (PR#6541)\n\n    o\tvector(), matrix(), array() and their internal equivalents\n\treport correctly that the number of elements specified was too\n\tlarge (rather than reporting it as negative).\n\n    o\tMinor copy-paste error in example(names).  (PR#6594)\n\n    o\tlength&lt;-() now works correctly on factors (and is now generic\n\twith a method for factors).\n\n    o\tx &lt;- 2^32; x:(x+3) no longer generates an error (but gives a\n\tresult of type &quot;double&quot;).\n\n    o\tpgamma(30, 100, lower=FALSE, log=TRUE) is not quite 0, now.\n\tpgamma(x, alph) now only uses a normal approximation for\n\talph &gt; 1e5 instead of alph &gt; 1000.  This also improves the accuracy\n\tof ppois().\n\n    o\tqgamma() now does one or more final Newton steps, increasing\n\taccuracy from around 2e-8 to 3e-16 in some cases.  (PR#2214).\n\tIt allows values p close to 1 not returning Inf, with accuracy for\n\t'lower=FALSE', and values close to 0 not returning 0 for\n\t'log=TRUE'.  These also apply to qchisq(), e.g.,\n\tqchisq(1e-13, 4, lower=FALSE) is now finite and\n\tqchisq(1e-101, 1) is positive.\n\n    o\tgamma(-n) now gives NaN for all negative integers -n.\n\n    o\tThe Unix version of browseURL() now protects the URL from the\n\tshell, for example allowing &amp; and $ to occur in the URL.\n\n\tIt was incorrectly attempting to use -remote &quot;openURL()&quot; for\n\tunknown browsers.\n\n    o\textractAIC.coxph() works around an inconsistency in the\n\t$loglik output from coxph.  (PR#6646)\n\n    o\tstem() was running into integer overflows with nearly-constant\n\tinputs, and scaling badly for constant ones.  (Partly PR#6645)\n\n    o\tsystem() under Unix was losing the 8095th char if the output\n\twas split.  (PR#6624)\n\n    o\tplot.lm() gave incorrect results if there were zero weights.\n\t(PR#6640)\n\n    o\tBinary operators warned for inconsistent lengths on vector op\n\tvector operations, but not on vector op matrix ones.  (PR#6633\n\tand more.)\n\n\tComparison operators did not warn about inconsistent lengths\n\tfor real vectors, but did for integer, logical and character\n\tvectors.\n\n    o\tspec.pgram(x, ..., pad, fast, ...) computed the periodogram with\n\ta bias (downward) whenever 'pad &gt; 0' (non-default) or 'fast = TRUE'\n\t(default) and nextn(n) &gt; n where n = length(x); similarly for\n\t'df' (approximate degrees of freedom for chisq).\n\n    o\tdgamma(0, a) now gives Inf for a &lt; 1 (instead of NaN), and\n\tso does dchisq(0, 2*a, ncp).\n\n    o\tpcauchy() is now correct in the extreme tails.\n\n    o\tfile.copy() did not check that any existing `from' file had\n\tbeen truncated before appending the new contents.\n\n    o\tThe QC files now check that their file operations succeeded.\n\n    o\treplicate() worked by making the supplied expression the\n\tbody of an anonymous function(x), leading to a variable\n\tcapture issue. Now, function(...) is used instead.\n\n    o\tchisq.test(simulate.p.value = TRUE) was returning slightly\n\tincorrect p values, notably p = 0 when the data gave the most\n\textreme value.\n\n    o\tterms.formula(simplify = TRUE) was losing offset terms.\n\tMultiple offset terms were not being removed correctly if two\n\tof them appeared first or last in the formula.\t(PR#6656)\n\n    o\tRd conversion to latex did not add a new line before\n\t\\end{Section} in more cases than were corrected in 1.8.1.\n\n    o\tsplit.default() dropped NA levels in its internal code but\n\treturned them as NA in all components in the interpreted code\n\tfor factors.  (PR#6672)\n\n    o\tpoints.formula() had problems if there was a subset argument\n\tand no data argument.  (PR#6652)\n\n    o\tas.dist() does a bit more checking of its first argument and now\n\twarns when applied to non-square matrices.\n\n    o\tmle() gives a more understandable error message when its 'start'\n\targument is not ok.\n\n    o\tAll uses of dir.create() check the return value.\n\tdownload.packages() checks that destdir exists and is a directory.\n\n    o\tMethods dispatch corrects an error that failed to find\n\tmethods for classes that extend sealed classes (class unions\n\tthat contain basic classes, e.g.).\n\n    o\tSweave no longer wraps the output of code chunks with\n\techo=false and results=tex in Schunk environments.\n\n    o\ttermplot() handles models with missing data better, especially\n\twith na.action=na.exclude.\n\n    o\t1:2 * 1e-100  now prints with correct number of spaces.\n\n    o\tNegative subscripts that were out of range or NA were not handled\n\tcorrectly.  Mixing negative and NA subscripts is now caught as\n\tan error: it was not caught on some platforms and segfaulted\n\ton others.\n\n    o\tgzfile() connections had trouble at EOF when used on uncompressed\n\tfile.\n\n    o\tThe Unix version of dataentry segfaulted if the `Copy' button\n\twas used.  (PR#6605)\n\n    o\tunlist on lists containing expressions now works (PR#5628)\n\n    o\tD(), deriv() and deriv3() now also can deal with gamma and lgamma.\n\n    o\tThe X11 module can now be built against XFree86 4.4.0 headers (still\n\twith some warnings).\n\n    o\tseq.POSIXt(from, to, by=&quot;DSTdays&quot;) was shorter than expected\n\tfor rare times in the UK time zone.  (PR#4558)\n\n    o\tc/rbind() did not support vectors/matrices of mode &quot;list&quot;.  (PR#6702)\n\n    o\tsummary() methods for POSIX[cl]t and Date classes coerced the\n\tnumber of NAs to a date on printing.\n\n    o\tKalmanSmooth would sometimes return NA values with NA inputs.\n\t(PR#6738)\n\n    o\tfligner.test() worked correctly only if data were already sorted\n\tby group levels.

This is a patch version\nmostly fixing a number of issues in 1.8.0, some of which were quite\nserious. As usual, a few new features have crept in as well. (See below\nfor details.)\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.8.1.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.8.1.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries\nfor various platforms will appear in due course.\n \nThere is also a version split for floppies.\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\ncd81fdeaf22f93dfc28979e8132722ec  R-1.8.1.tgz\n5690ed4e1f453115551122facb4b34b0  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.aa\ncd2fd749085c1e63fce22e3e09f70cdb  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.ab\nab0b08746d1f5bd56a736a8b1f5bfee6  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.ac\n41332e09272598bfb64c25ac84274404  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.ad\n51d3f4e376efdee4ae069b135f909621  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.ae\nc50f27fdf41c44c71c5b4f285a2dd98f  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.af\n2eb71e8a54e41b3e30e3e40f35151aa0  R-1.8.1.tgz-split.ag\n\nOn behalf of the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter Dalgaard\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.8.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tThere is now a &quot;Complex&quot; S3 group generic (a side-effect of\n\tfixing up the corresponding S4 group generic).\n\n    o\thelp(&quot;regex&quot;) now gives a description of the regular expressions\n\tused in R.\n\n    o\tThe startup message now shows the R Foundation as copyright\n\tholder, and includes the R ISBN number and a pointer to the new\n\tcitation() function.\n\n    o\tThe solve() function now uses the `tol' argument for all\n\tnon-complex cases.  The default tolerance for LINPACK is 1e-7,\n\tas before.  For LAPACK it currently is .Machine$double.eps but\n\tmay be changed in later versions of R.\n\n    o\thelp.search() now defaults to agrep = FALSE when keyword= is\n\tspecified, since no one wants fuzzy matching of categories.\n\n    o\tFunction texi2dvi() in package tools can be used to compile\n\tlatex files from within R.\n\n    o\tObjects with formal S4 classes saved in pre-1.8 versions and\n\tloaded into the current version have incompatible class\n\tattributes (no package information).  A new function,\n\tfixPre1.8() in package methods, will fix the class attributes.\n\tSee the help for this function.\n\n    o\theatmap() allows Rowv/Colv = NA, suppressing the corresponding\n\tdendrogram.\n\n    o   An &quot;antifeature&quot;: Tcl 8.0 is now officially unsupported. In 1.8.0\n\tit just didn't work. This very old version lacks several features\n        that are needed for the new version of the tcltk package. R will\n\tstill build the tcltk package against Tcl 8.0 but the resulting\n\tpackage will not load.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tsymnum(x) now behaves as documented when length(x) == 0 and uses\n\tlower.triangular = FALSE for logical arrays.\n\n    o\tc() now has a method for &quot;noquote&quot; objects and hence works as\n\texpected.\n\n    o\tsplit(1:10, c(1,2)) no longer gives a spurious warning.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;Complex&quot; S4 group generic now works.\n\n    o\tabbreviate() doesn't get into infinite loops on input that differs\n\tonly by leading/trailing space\n\n    o\tAdded check for user interrupt in Rvprintf to allow printing to be\n\tinterrupted.\n\n    o\tFixed bug that would cause segfault on protect stack overflow.\n\n    o\tcrossprod() on matrices with zero extents would return an\n\tuninitialized matrix (rather than one filled with zeros).\n\n    o\tDF[[i,j]] for a data frame used row j and col i, not as intended\n\trow i and col j.\n\n    o\tEven more user errors in recursive indexing of lists are now\n\tcaught.\t (PR#4486)\n\n    o\tcor(&lt;matrix&gt;, use = &quot;pairwise&quot;) gave wrong result in 1.8.0 (only).\n\t(PR#4646)\n\n    o\tmerge.data.frame() could give incorrect names when one of the\n\targuments had only one column.\t(PR#4299)\n\n    o\tSubsetting a one-dimensional array dropped dimensions even when\n\tthey were not of length one.  (Related to PR#4110)\n\n    o\tThe plot() method for `ecdf' objects, plot.ecdf(), now allows to\n\tset a `ylab' argument (different from the default).\n\n    o\tcor.test(*, method=&quot;spearman&quot;) gave wrong results `randomly'\n\t(because of a wrong type passed to C; PR#4718).\n\n    o\tdist() objects with NA's didn't print these, now do. (PR#4866).\n\n    o\tregexpr(fixed = TRUE) returned 0-based indices.\n\n    o\tdf[, length_1_index] &lt;- value did not recycle short rhs. (PR#4820)\n\n    o\tmedian() no longer `works' for odd-length factor variables.\n\n    o\tpackageStatus() is more robust to failing to contact a\n\trepository, and contacts the correct paths in the repositories\n\tunder Windows.\n\n    o\t.setOldIs (methods) contained a typo stopping POSIXct objects (etc)\n\tbeing included in formal classes.\n\n    o\tterms() sometimes removed offset() terms incorrectly, since it\n\tcounted by variables and not terms.  Its &quot;offset&quot; attribute\n\twas incorrectly documented as referring to terms not\n\tvariables. (Related to PR#4941)\n\n    o\tbuildVignettes() and pkgVignettes() in package tools are now\n\tdocumented.  The call to texi2dvi is wrapped in the new\n\tfunction texi2dvi() which also works on Windows.\n\n    o   hclust() was sometimes not finding the correct inter-cluster\n\tdistances with non-monotone methods.  (PR#4195)\n\n    o   plot.hclust() now tolerates mode changes on dumped objects. (PR#4361)\n\n    o   prompt() no longer insists files are in the current directory.\n\t(PR#4978)\n\n    o   filter() did not use init in reverse order as documented. (PR#5017)\n\n    o\tcontrasts&lt;-() and model.matrix() now have sanity checks that\n\tfactors having at least 2 levels (or one level and a contrast\n\tmatrix): model.matrix() gave nonsensical results for 0-level\n\tfactors.\n\n    o   writeChar() could segfault if more characters were requested\n\tthan exist. (PR#5090)\n\n    o\tround() and signif() dropped attributes with 0-length inputs,\n\tonly. (PR#4710)\n\n    o\tThe default graphics device in the GNOME interface was gtk,\n\twhich is no longer in the base package. It is now X11.\n\n    o\tThe print button on the toolbar of the GNOME graphics device\n\tdid not work.\n\n    o\tThe example code on the man page for TkWidgetcmds had not been\n\tupdated after the change that made tkget (et al.) return\n\ttclObj objects, so the &quot;Submit&quot; button didn't work.\n\n    o\tRd conversion to latex did not add a new line before\n\t\\end{Section} for the section environments, which caused\n\tproblems if the last thing in a section was \\preformatted{}\n\t(and potentially elsewhere).\n\n    o\tUnder some circumstances mosaicplot() failed if main was\n\tsupplied as it was passed on to model.frame.default().\n\n    o\tConversion to POSIXlt (including printing) of POSIXct dates\n\tbefore 1902 and after 2038 computed which were leap years from\n\t(year-1900) so got some xx00 years wrong.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a new version\nwith major changes (see below). Notably, the Macintosh version for OS\nX has been substantially improved; the old Carbon interface is no\nlonger being supported.\n\nAlso notice that the underscore will no longer work as an assignment\noperator.\n\nThere is also a bunch of new functions and an assortment of bugs have\nbeen fixed.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.8.0.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.8.0.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries\nfor various platforms will appear in due course.\n \nThere is also a version split for floppies.\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\nbb019d7e12e38ac8a8bc247f06cc6b42  R-1.8.0.tgz\n80fd20fdd2b995ab69cfd8cde80267cf  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.aa\n074140872c9c015089543c9497a3be87  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.ab\nf0e6005491839dd27636020f6475f4e2  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.ac\ne7e817911d57e3c88959d6b86c061dd5  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.ad\n52e9aff83357b65926f422abececba92  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.ae\n6c6965e7f97b627280326ec6c436ab48  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.af\n00ce1b1384f403ba76d8de302e92da1d  R-1.8.0.tgz-split.ag\n\nOn behalf of the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter Dalgaard\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.8.0\n\n\nMACOS CHANGES\n\n    o\tAs from this release there is only one R port for the\n\tMacintosh, which runs only on MacOS X.\t(The `Carbon' port has\n\tbeen discontinued, and the `Darwin' port is part of the new\n\tversion.)   The current version can be run either as a\n\tcommand-line application or as an `Aqua' console.  There is a\n\t`Quartz' device quartz(), and the download and installation of\n\tboth source and binary packages is supported from the Aqua\n\tconsole.  Those CRAN and BioC packages which build under MacOS\n\tX have binary versions updated daily.\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe defaults for glm.control(epsilon=1e-8, maxit=25) have been\n\ttightened: this will produce more accurate results, slightly\n\tslower.\n\n    o\tsub, gsub, grep, regexpr, chartr, tolower, toupper, substr,\n\tsubstring, abbreviate and strsplit now handle missing values\n\tdifferently from &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o\tSaving data containing name space references no longer warns\n\tabout name spaces possibly being unavailable on load.\n\n    o\tOn Unix-like systems interrupt signals now set a flag that is\n\tchecked periodically rather than calling longjmp from the\n\tsignal handler.\t This is analogous to the behavior on Windows.\n\tThis reduces responsiveness to interrupts but prevents bugs\n\tcaused by interrupting computations in a way that leaves the\n\tsystem in an inconsistent state.  It also reduces the number\n\tof system calls, which can speed up computations on some\n\tplatforms and make R more usable with systems like Mosix.\n\n\nCHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE\n\n    o\tError and warning handling has been modified to incorporate a\n\tflexible condition handling mechanism.\tSee the online\n\tdocumentation of 'tryCatch' and 'signalCondition'.  Code that\n\tdoes not use these new facilities should remain unaffected.\n\n    o\tA triple colon operator can be used to access values of internal\n\tvariables in a name space (i.e. a:::b is the value of the internal\n\tvariable b in name space a).\n\n    o\tNon-syntactic variable names can now be specified by inclusion\n\tbetween backticks `Like This`.\tThe deparse() code has been\n\tchanged to output non-syntactical names with this convention,\n\twhen they occur as operands in expressions.  This is controlled\n\tby a `backtick' argument, which is by default TRUE for\n\tcomposite expressions and FALSE for single symbols.  This\n\tshould give minimal interference with existing code.\n\n    o\tVariables in formulae can be quoted by backticks, and such\n\tformulae can be used in the common model-fitting functions.\n\tterms.formula() will quote (by backticks) non-syntactic names\n\tin its &quot;term.labels&quot; attribute.\t [Note that other code using\n\tterms objects may expect syntactic names and/or not accept\n\tquoted names: such code will still work if the new feature is\n\tnot used.]\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tNew function bquote() does partial substitution like LISP backquote.\n\n    o\tcapture.output() takes arbitrary connections for `file' argument.\n\n    o\tcontr.poly() has a new `scores' argument to use as the base set\n\tfor the polynomials.\n\n    o\tcor() has a new argument `method = c(&quot;pearson&quot;,&quot;spearman&quot;,&quot;kendall&quot;)'\n\tas cor.test() did forever. The two rank based measures do work with\n\tall three missing value strategies.\n\n    o\tNew utility function cov2cor() {Cov -&gt; Corr matrix}.\n\n    o\tcut.POSIXt() now allows `breaks' to be more general intervals\n\tas allowed for the `by' argument to seq.POSIXt().\n\n    o\tdata() now has an 'envir' argument.\n\n    o\tdet() uses an LU decomposition and LAPACK.  The `method'\n\targument to det() no longer has any effect.\n\n    o\tdev.control() now accepts &quot;enable&quot; as well as &quot;inhibit&quot;.\n\t(Wishlist PR#3424)\n\n    o\t*, - and / work more generally on &quot;difftime&quot; objects, which now\n\thave a diff() method.\n\n    o\tdt(*, ncp = V)\tis now implemented, thanks to Claus Ekstroem.\n\n    o\tdump() only quotes object names in the file where necessary.\n\n    o\teval() of a promise forces the promise\n\n    o\tfile.path() now returns an empty character vector if given at\n\tleast one zero-length argument.\n\n    o\tformat() and hence print() make an effort to handle corrupt\n\tdata frames, with a warning.\n\n    o\tformat.info() now also works with `nsmall' in analogy with\n\tformat.default().\n\n    o\tgamma(n) is very slightly more precise for integer n in 11:50.\n\n    o\t? and help() will accept more un-quoted arguments, e.g. NULL.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;?&quot; operator has new forms for querying documentation on\n\tS4 methods.  See the online documentation.\n\n    o\tNew argument frame.plot = axes (== TRUE)  for filled.contour().\n\n    o\tNew argument fixed = TRUE for grep() and regexpr() to avoid the\n\tneed to escape strings to match.\n\n    o\tgrep(x, ..., value = TRUE) preserves names of x.\n\n    o\thist.POSIXt() can now pass arguments to hist.default()\n\n    o\tlegend() and symbols() now make use of xy.coords() and accept\n\ta wider range of coordinate specifications.\n\n    o\tAdded function library.dynam.unload() to call dyn.unload() on\n\ta loaded DLL and tidy up.  This is called for all the standard\n\tpackages in namespaces with DLLs if their namespaces are unloaded.\n\n    o\tlm(singular.ok = FALSE) is now implemented.\n\n    o\tEmpty lm() and glm() fits are now handled by the normal\n\tcode: there are no methods for classes &quot;lm.null&quot; and\n\t&quot;glm.null&quot;.  Zero-rank fits are handled consistently.\n\n    o\tmake.names() has improvements, and there is a new auxiliary\n\tfunction make.unique().\t (Based on code contributed by Tom\n\tMinka, since converted to a .Internal function.)  In\n\tparticular make.names() now recognises that names beginning\n\twith a dot are valid and that reserved words are not.\n\n    o\tmethods() has a print method which asterisks functions which\n\tare not user-visible.  methods(class = &quot;foo&quot;) now lists\n\tnon-visible functions, and checks that there is a matching generic.\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix() now warns when it removes the response from the\n\trhs of the formula: that this happens is now documented on its\n\thelp page.\n\n    o\tNew option `locatorBell' to control the confirmation beep\n\tduring the use of locator() and identify().\n\n    o\tNew option(&quot;scipen&quot;) provides some user control over the\n\tprinting of numbers in fixed-point or exponential notation.\n\t(Contributed by David Brahm.)\n\n    o\tplot.formula() now accepts horizontal=TRUE and works correctly\n\twhen boxplots are produced.  (Wishlist PR#1207)\t The code has\n\tbeen much simplified and corrected.\n\n    o\tpolygon() and rect() now interpret density &lt; 0 or NA to mean\n\tfilling (by colour) is desired: this allows filling and\n\tshading to be mixed in one call, e.g. from legend().\n\n    o\tThe predict() methods for classes lm, glm, mlm and lqs take a\n\t`na.action' argument that controls how missing values in\n\t`newdata' are handled (and defaults to predicting NA).\n\t[Previously the value of getOption(&quot;na.action&quot;) was used and\n\tthis by default omitted cases with missing values, even if set\n\tto `na.exclude'.]\n\n    o\tprint.summary.glm() now reports omitted coefficients in the\n\tsame way as print.summary.lm(), and both show them as NAs in\n\tthe table of coefficients.\n\n    o\tprint.table() has a new argument `zero.print' and is now\n\tdocumented.\n\n    o\trank(x, na.last = &quot;keep&quot;) now preserves NAs in `x', and the\n\targument `ties.method' allows to use non-averaging ranks in the\n\tpresence of ties.\n\n    o\tread.table()'s 'as.is' argument can be character, naming columns\n\tnot to be converted.\n\n    o\trep() is now a generic function, with default, POSIXct and\n\tPOSIXlt methods.  For efficiency, the base code uses rep.int()\n\trather than rep() where possible.\n\n    o\tNew function replicate() for repeated evaluation of expression\n\tand collection of results, wrapping a common use of sapply()\n\tfor simulation purposes.\n\n    o\trev() is now a generic function, with default and dendrogram\n\tmethods.\n\n    o\tserialize() and unserialize() functions are available for\n\tlow-level serialization to connections.\n\n    o\tsocketSelect() allows waiting on multiple sockets.\n\n    o\tsort(method = &quot;quick&quot;, decreasing = TRUE) is now implemented.\n\n    o\tsort.list() has methods &quot;quick&quot; (a wrapper for sort(method =\n\t&quot;quick&quot;, index.return = TRUE) and &quot;radix&quot; (a very fast method\n\tfor small integers).  The default &quot;shell&quot; method works faster\n\ton long vectors with many ties.\n\n    o\tstripchart() now has `log', `add' and `at' arguments.\n\n    o\tstrsplit(x, *) now preserves names() but won't work for\n\tnon-character `x' anymore {formerly used as.character(x),\n\tdestroying names(x)}.\n\n    o\ttextConnection() now has a local argument for use with output\n\tconnections.  local = TRUE means the variable containing the\n\toutput is assigned in the frame of the caller.\n\n    o\tUsing UseMethod() with more than two arguments now gives a\n\twarning (as R-lang.texi has long claimed it did).\n\n    o\tNew function vignette() for viewing or listing vignettes.\n\n    o\twhich.min(x) and which.max(x) now preserve names.\n\n    o\txy.coords() coerces &quot;POSIXt&quot; objects to &quot;POSIXct&quot;, allowing\n\tlines etc to added to plot.POSIXlt() plots.\n\n    o\t.Machine has a new entry, sizeof.pointer.\n\n    o\t.Random.seed is only looked for and stored in the user's\n\tworkspace.  Previously the first place a variable of that name\n\twas found on the search path was used.\n\n    o\tSubscripting for data.frames has been rationalized:\n\n\t- Using a single argument now ignores any `drop' argument\n\t  (with a warning).  Previously using `drop' inhibited list-like\n\t  subscripting.\n\n\t- adf$name &lt;- value now checks for the correct length of\n\t  `value', replicating a whole number of times if needed.\n\n\t- adf[j] &lt;- value and adf[[j]] &lt;- value did not convert\n\t  character vectors to factors, but adf[,j] &lt;- value did.\n\t  Now none do.\tNor is a list `value' coerced to a data frame\n\t  (thereby coercing character elements to factors).\n\n\t- Where replicating the replacement value a whole number of\n\t  times will produce the right number of values, this is\n\t  always done (rather than some times but not others).\n\n\t- Replacement list values can include NULL elements.\n\n\t- Subsetting a data frame can no longer produce duplicate\n\t  column names.\n\n\t- Subsetting with drop=TRUE no longer sometimes drops\n\t  dimensions on matrix or data frame columns of the data frame.\n\n\t- Attributes are no longer stripped when replacing part of a column.\n\n\t- Columns added in replacement operations will always be\n\t  named, using the names of a list value if appropriate.\n\n\t- as.data.frame.list() did not cope with list names such as\n\t  `check.rows',\t and formatting/printing data frames with such\n\t  column names now works.\n\n\t- Row names in extraction are still made unique, but without\n\t  forcing them to be syntactic names.\n\n\t- adf[x] &lt;- list() failed if x was of length zero.\n\n\n    o\tSetting dimnames to a factor now coerces to character, as S\n\tdoes.  (Earlier versions of R used the internal codes.)\n\n    o\tWhen coercion of a list fails, a meaningful error message is given.\n\n    o\tAdding to NULL with [[ ]] generates a list if more than one\n\telement is added (as S does).\n\n    o\tThere is a new command-line flag --args that causes the rest of\n\tthe command line to be skipped (but recorded in commandArgs()\n\tfor further processing).\n\n    o\tS4 generic functions and method dispatch have been modified to\n\tmake the generic functions more self-contained (e.g., usable\n\tin apply-type operations) and potentially to speed dispatch.\n\n    o\tThe data editor is no longer limited to 65535 rows, and will\n\tbe substantially faster for large numbers of columns.\n\n    o\tStandalone Rmath now has a get_seed function as requested (PR#3160).\n\n    o\tGC timing is not enabled until the first call to gc.time(); it\n\tcan be disabled by calling gc.time(FALSE).  This can speed up\n\tthe garbage collector and reduce system calls on some\n\tplatforms.\n\n    o\ttextConnection() now has a local argument for use with output\n\tconnections. local = TRUE means the variable containing the output\n\tis assigned in the frame of the caller.\n\n\nSTANDARD PACKAGES\n\n    o\tNew package 'mle'. This is a simple package to find maximum\n\tlikelihood estimates, and perform likelihood profiling and\n\tapproximate confidence limits based upon it.  A well-behaved\n\tlikelihood function is assumed, and it is the responsibility\n\tof the user to gauge the applicability of the asymptotic\n\ttheory.  This package is based on S4 methods and classes.\n\n    o\tChanges in package 'mva':\n\n\t- factanal() now returns the test statistic and P-value formerly\n\t  computed in the print method.\n\n\t- heatmap() has many more arguments, partly thanks to Wolfgang\n\t  Huber and Andy Liaw.\n\n\t- Arguments `unit' and `hmin' of plclust() are now implemented.\n\n\t- prcomp() now accepts complex matrices, and there is biplot()\n\t  method for its output (in the real case).\n\n\t- dendrograms are slightly better documented, methods working with\n\t  &quot;label&quot;, not &quot;text&quot; attribute.  New rev() method for dendrograms.\n\n\t- plot.dendrogram() has an explicit `frame.plot' argument\n\t  defaulting to FALSE (instead of an implicit one defaulting to TRUE).\n\n    o\tChanges in package 'tcltk':\n\n\t- The package is now in a namespace.  To remove it you will\n\t  now need to use unloadNamespace(&quot;tcltk&quot;).\n\n\t- The interface to Tcl has been made much more efficient by\n\t  evaluating Tcl commands via a vector of Tcl objects rather\n\t  than by constructing the string representation.\n\n\t- An interface to Tcl arrays has been introduced.\n\n\t- as.tclObj() has gained a `drop' argument to resolve an\n\t  ambiguity for vectors of length one.\n\n    o\tChanges in package 'tools':\n\n\t- Utilities for testing and listing files, manipulating file\n\t  paths, and delimited pattern matching are now exported.\n\n\t- Functions checkAssignFuns(), checkDocArgs() and checkMethods()\n\t  have been renamed to checkReplaceFuns(), checkDocFiles(), and\n\t  checkS3methods, to given better descriptions of what they do.\n\n\t- R itself is now used for analyzing the markup in the \\usage\n\t  sections.  Hence in particular, replacement functions or S3\n\t  replacement methods are no longer ignored.\n\n\t- checkDocFiles() now also determines 'over-documented' arguments\n\t  which are given in the \\arguments section but not in \\usage.\n\n\t- checkDocStyle() and checkS3Methods() now know about internal S3\n\t  generics and S3 group generics.\n\n\t- S4 classes and methods are included in the QC tests.\n\t  Warnings will be issued from undoc() for classes  and\n\t  methods defined but not documented.  Default methods\n\t  automatically generated from nongeneric functions do not\n\t  need to be documented.\n\n\t- New (experimental) functions codocClasses() and codocData()\n\t  for code/documentation consistency checking for S4 classes and\n\t  data sets.\n\n    o\tChanges in package 'ts':\n\n\t- arima.sim() now checks for inconsistent order specification\n\t  (as requested in PR#3495: it was previously documented not to).\n\n\t- decompose() has a new argument `filter'.\n\n\t- HoltWinters() has new arguments `optim.start' and\n\t  `optim.control', and returns more components in the fitted\n\t  values.  The plot method allows `ylim' to be set.\n\n\t- plot.ts() has a new argument `nc' controlling the number of\n\t  columns (with default the old behaviour for plot.mts).\n\n\t- StructTS() now allows the first value of the series to be\n\t  missing (although it is better to omit leading NAs). (PR#3990)\n\n\nUSING PACKAGES\n\n    o\tlibrary() has a pos argument, controlling where the package is\n\tattached (defaulting to pos=2 as before).\n\n    o\trequire() now maintains a list of required packages in the\n\ttoplevel environment (typically, .GlobalEnv).  Two features\n\tuse this:  detach() now warns if a package is detached that is\n\trequired by an attached package, and packages that install\n\twith saved images no longer need to use require() in the\n\t.First as well as in the main source.\n\n    o\tPackages with name spaces can now be installed using --save.\n\n    o\tPackages that use S4 classes and methods should now work with\n\tor without saved images (saved images are still recommended\n\tfor efficiency), writing setMethod(), etc. calls with the\n\tdefault for argument `where'.  The topenv() function and\n\tsys.source() have been changed correspondingly.\t See the\n\tonline help.\n\n    o\tUsers can specify in the DESCRIPTION file the collation order\n\tfor files in the R source directory of a package.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tChanges in R documentation format:\n\n\t- New logical markup commands for emphasizing (\\strong) and\n\t  quoting (\\sQuote and \\dQuote) text, for indicating the usage\n\t  of an S4 method (\\S4method), and for indicating specific kinds\n\t  of text (\\acronym, \\cite, \\command, \\dfn, \\env, \\kbd, \\option,\n\t  \\pkg, \\samp, \\var).\n\n\t- New markup \\preformatted for pre-formatted blocks of text\n\t  (like \\example but within another section).  (Based on a\n\t  contribution by Greg Warnes.)\n\n\t- New markup \\concept for concept index entries for use by\n\t  help.search().\n\n    o\tRdconv now produces more informative output from the special\n\t\\method{GENERIC}{CLASS} markup for indicating the usage of S3\n\tmethods, providing the CLASS info in a comment.\n\n    o\t\\dontrun sections are now marked within comments in the\n\tuser-readable versions of the converted help pages.\n\n    o\t\\dontshow is now the preferred name for \\testonly.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe zlib code in the sources is used unless the external\n\tversion found is at least version 1.1.4 (up from 1.1.3).\n\n    o\tThe regression checks now have to be passed exactly, except\n\tthose depending on recommended packages (which cannot be\n\tassumed to be present).\n\n    o\tThe target make check-all now runs R CMD check on all the\n\trecommended packages (and not just runs their examples).\n\n    o\tThere are new macros DYLIB_* for building dynamic libraries,\n\tand these are used for the dynamic Rmath library (which was\n\tpreviously built as a shared object).\n\n    o\tIf a system function log1p is found, it is tested for accuracy\n\tand if inadequate the substitute function in src/nmath is\n\tused, with name remapped to Rlog1p.  (Apparently needed on\n\tOpenBSD/NetBSD.)\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tThere is a new installed header file R_ext/Parse.h which\n\tallows R_ParseVector to be called by those writing extensions.\n\t(Note that the interface is changed from that used in the\n\tunexported header Parse.h in earlier versions, and is not\n\tguaranteed to remain unchanged.)\n\n    o\tThe header R_ext/Mathlib.h has been removed.  It was replaced by\n\tRmath.h in R 1.2.0.\n\n    o\tPREXPR has been replaced by two macros, PREXPR for obtaining the\n\texpression and PRCODE for obtaining the code for use in eval.\n\tThe macro BODY_EXPR has been added for use with closures.\n\tFor a closure with a byte compiled body, the macro BODY_EXPR\n\treturns the expression that was compiled; if the body is not\n\tcompiled then the body is returned.  This is to support byte\n\tcompilation.\n\n    o\tInternal support for executing byte compiled code has been added.\n\tA compiler for producing byte compiled code will be made available\n\tseparately and should become part of a future R release.\n\n    o\tOn Unix-like systems calls to the popen() and system() C library\n\tfunctions now go through R_popen and R_system.\tOn Mac OS X these\n\tsuspend SIGALRM interrupts around the library call.  (Related to\n\tPR#1140.)\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD check accepts &quot;ORPHANED&quot; as package maintainer. Package\n\tmaintainers can now officially orphan a package, i.e., resign\n\tfrom maintaining a package.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL (Unix only) is now 'safe': if the attempt to\n\tinstall a package fails, leftovers are removed.\t If the package\n\twas already installed, the old version is restored.\n\n    o\tR CMD build excludes possible (obsolete) data and vignette\n\tindices in DCF format (and hence also no longer rebuilds them).\n\n    o\tR CMD check now tests whether file names are valid across file\n\tsystems and supported operating system platforms.  There is some\n\tsupport for code/documentation consistency checking for data\n\tsets and S4 classes.  Replacement functions and S3 methods in\n\t\\usage sections are no longer ignored.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rdindex has been removed.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe assignment operator `_' has been removed.\n\n    o\tprintNoClass() is defunct.\n\n    o\tThe classic MacOS port is no longer supported, and its files\n\thave been removed from the sources.\n\n    o\tThe deprecated argument 'white' of parse() has been removed.\n\n    o\tMethods pacf/plot.mts() have been removed and their functionality\n\tincorporated into pacf.default/plot.ts().\n\n    o\tprint.coefmat() is deprecated in favour of printCoefmat()\n\t(which is identical apart from the default for na.print which\n\tis changed from &quot;&quot; to &quot;NA&quot;, and better handling of the 0-rank\n\tcase where all coefficients are missing).\n\n    o\tcodes() and codes&lt;-() are deprecated, as almost all uses\n\tmisunderstood what they actually do.\n\n    o\tThe use of multi-argument return() calls is deprecated: use a\n\t(named) list instead.\n\n    o\tanovalist.lm (replaced in 1.2.0) is now deprecated.\n\n    o\t- and Ops methods for POSIX[cl]t objects are removed: the\n\tPOSIXt methods have been used since 1.3.0.\n\n    o\tglm.fit.null(), lm.fit.null() and lm.wfit.null() are deprecated.\n\n    o\tClasses &quot;lm.null&quot; and &quot;glm.null&quot; are deprecated and all of their\n\tmethods have been removed.\n\n    o\tMethod weights.lm(), a copy of weights.default(), has been removed.\n\n    o\tprint.atomic() is now deprecated.\n\n    o\tThe back-compatibility entry point Rf_log1p in standalone\n\tRmath has been removed.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tARMAacf() sometimes gave too many results or failed if `lag.max'\n\twas used.\n\n    o\tFunctions anova.glm(), contrasts(), getS3method(), glm() and\n\tmake.tables() were applying get() without asking for a\n\tfunction and/or not starting the search in the environment of\n\tthe caller.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame.matrix() ignored the `row.names' argument.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame.list(optional = TRUE) was converting names, and\n\thence data.frame(list(...), check.names = FALSE) was.  (PR#3280)\n\n    o\tas.dist(m) {mva} now obeys `diag=TRUE' or `upper=TRUE' in all cases.\n\n    o\tas.double(list()) etc was regarded as an error, because of a\n\tbug in isVectorizable.\n\n    o\tOn some platforms the wday component of the result of\n\tas.POSIXlt() was corrupted when trying to guess the DST offset\n\tat dates the OS was unable to handle.\n\n    o\tave(x, g) didn't work when `g' had unused levels.\n\n    o\tbiplot.default() allows xlim and ylim to be set.  (PR#3168)\n\n    o\tbgroup with a null (.) delimiter was setting font to Greek.  (PR#3099)\n\n    o\tbody() and formals() were looking for named functions in\n\tdifferent places: they now both look starting at the\n\tenvironment in which they are called.  Several documentation\n\terrors for these functions have been corrected.\n\n    o\tboxplot() was ignoring cex.axis.  (PR#2628)\n\n    o\tcut.POSIXt() now passes on ... to cut.default(), as documented.\n\n    o\tcrossprod() now works for 1d arrays with unnamed dimnames (PR#4092).\n\n    o\tdata() sometimes failed with multiple files, as the paths\n\tvariable got corrupted.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() failed with a nonsensical error message if it\n\tgrabbed row names from an argument that was subsequently\n\trecycled.  Now they are discarded, with a warning.\n\n    o\tdata.matrix() was documented to replace factors by their\n\tcodes, but in fact re-coded into the alphabetical ordering of\n\tthe levels.\n\n    o\tdecompose() with even frequency used an asymmetric moving\n\taverage window.\n\n    o\tdemo() was using `topic' as a regexp rather than an exact match.\n\n    o\tdotchart() now does recycle the `color' argument and better\n\tdocuments the `bg' one (PR#4343).\n\n    o\tgetAnywhere() didn't not correctly check for S3 methods, when\n\tthe generic or the class name contains a &quot;.&quot; (PR#4275).\n\n    o\tfile.copy() ignored the overwrite argument.  (PR#3529)\n\n    o\tfilter(method=&quot;recursive&quot;) was unnecessarily requiring the\n\ttime series to be longer than the filter.\n\n    o\tformat(*, nsmall = m) with m &gt; 0 now returns exponential format\n\tless often.\n\n    o\tget() and exists() were ignoring the `mode' argument for\n\tvariables in base.  The error message for get() now mentions\n\tthe mode requested if not &quot;any&quot;.  A bug in setting the NAMED\n\tfield in do_get was fixed.\n\n    o\tgetS3method(f, cl, optional=TRUE) now returns NULL if `f' does\n\tnot exist.\n\n    o\tHoltWinters() would segfault if only gamma was optimized, and\n\tnot converge if gamma=0 and seasonal=&quot;mult&quot;.\n\n    o\thyperref.cfg now contains definitions for colors it uses.\n\n    o\tidentify.default() detects zero-length arguments.  (PR#4057)\n\n    o\tlegend() allows shading without filling again.\n\n    o\tlegend(x, y, leg) doesn't triple `leg' anymore when it is a call.\n\n    o\tCorrected many problems with 0-rank (but not necessarily empty\n\tmodel) lm() and glm() fits.\n\n    o\tlm.influence() now handles 0-rank models, and names its output\n\tappropriately.\tIt also ensures that hat values are not greater\n\tthan one, and rounds values within rounding error of one.\n\n    o\tThe `method' argument to loess() did not work.\t(PR#3332)\n\n    o\tlsfit() was returning incorrect residuals for 0-rank fits.\n\n    o\tmethods(&quot;$&quot;) and methods(&quot;$&lt;-&quot;) were failing to find methods.\n\n    o\tmethods() and getS3method() find methods if the generic\n\tdispatches on a name other than its own.  (The cases of\n\tcoefficients() and fitted.values() were fixed in 1.7.1.)\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix.default() was throwing an error on 0-term models,\n\tbut now handles them correctly.\n\n    o\tPrinting `nls' objects misbehaved when `data' was a composite\n\texpression.\n\n    o\t.NotYetImplemented() gave &quot;Error in .NotYet...(): ..&quot;\n\n    o\tnumericDeriv() was failing if the first argument was a name\n\trather than a call.  (PR#3746)\n\n    o\tpacf() was failing if called on a one-column matrix.\n\n    o\tpaste() applied to 0-length vectors gave &quot;&quot; not a 0-length vector.\n\n    o\tThe length of a string specification of par(lty=) is now checked: it\n\tshould be 2, 4, 6 or 8.\n\n    o\tUsing lty=as.integer(NA) and as.double(NA) were being accepted\n\tbut giving nonsensical results.\t Those are not documented\n\tvalid values for lty.  (PR#3217)\n\n    o\tErroneously calling par(new=TRUE) with no plot was not caught\n\tand so could result in invalid graphics files.\t(PR#4037)\n\n    o\tpar(tck=) was being interpreted incorrectly.  It is now\n\tdocumented in the same way as S, and now behaves as\n\tdocumented.  (PR#3504)\n\n    o\tplclust() [and hence plot.hclust()] sometimes now uses correct `ylim's\n\talso in unusual cases.\t(PR#4197)\n\n    o\tplot.POSIX[cl]t no longer passes col, lty, lwd to axis.POSIXt.\n\n    o\tThe png(), jpeg(), png() and win.metafile() devices now\n\tenforce the length limit on the filename.  (PR#3466)\n\n    o\tpnorm(x, 1, 0) does not give NaN anymore;\n\talso, pnorm(x, m, s=Inf) == lim{s -&gt; Inf} pnorm(x,m,s).\n\tSimilar changes for dnorm(), cf PR#1218.\n\n    o\tOn some machines the internal rounding used in postscript() was\n\timperfect, causing unnecessarily verbose output (-0.00 instead of\n\t0) and problems with make check.\n\n    o\tqqnorm()'s result now keeps NAs from its input. (PR#3750)\n\n    o\trank() sometimes preserved and sometimes dropped names.\n\n    o\treadBin(what = &quot;foo&quot;) didn't convert `what' to its type.  (PR#4043)\n\n    o\treorder.dendrogram() now properly resets the &quot;midpoint&quot; attributes\n\tsuch that reorder()ed dendrograms now plot properly.\n\n    o\trmultinom(1,100, c(3, 4, 2, 0,0))[3] was NA. (PR#4431)\n\n    o\tsapply() for matrix result does not return list(NULL,NULL) dimnames\n\tanymore.\n\n    o\tscan() now interprets quoting in fields to be skipped.\t(PR#4128)\n\n    o\tseq.POSIXt(from, to, by=&quot;DSTday&quot;) was failing or calculating\n\tthe length incorrectly.\n\n    o\tsort() and unique.default() were failing on 0-level factors.\n\n    o\tstep() adds a fuzz for reduction in AIC for 0-df terms.\t (PR#3491)\n\n    o\tstr(x) gives better output when x is of mode &quot;(&quot;.  Its &quot;dendrogram&quot;\n\tmethod obeys the `give.attr' argument which now defaults to FALSE.\n\n    o\tstrwidth(f) and strheight(f) could seg.fault when `f' was a\n\tfunction.  The fix [to C-level coerceVector()] now gives an error\n\tinstead of passing through.  This may catch other potential\n\tproblems.\n\n    o\tSweave() reports the chunk number rather than the driver call when\n\ta try error gets caught.\n\n    o\ttrunc.POSIXt(x) for 0-length x does not return invalid structures\n\tanymore.  (PR#3763).\n\n    o\twarnings() now returns NULL instead of an error when no warnings\n\thave occured yet.  (PR#4389)\n\n    o\tUsing write.table() setting the `dec' argument and with no\n\tnumeric columns failed.\t (PR#3532)\n\n    o\t$&lt;- did not duplicate when it needed to.\n\n    o\tRecursive indexing of lists had too little error-checking.\n\t(related to PR#3324)\n\n    o\tRemoved warning about names in persistent strings when a\n\tnamespace is saved.\n\n    o\tFixed some malformed error messages in the methods package.\n\n    o\tpipes were not opening properly when profiling on a Mac. (PR#1140)\n\n    o\tLapack error messages (PR#3494) and call to DGEQP3 (PR#2867) are\n\tcorrected.\n\n    o\tRd conversion was limiting a file to 1000 pairs of braces,\n\twithout any warning.  Now the limit is 10000, with a warning.\n\t(PR#3400)\n\n    o\tIn the tcltk package, the tkimage.*() commands were defined\n\tnonsensically as widget commands. They have been redefined to be\n\tmore useful now.\n\n    o\tRegistered group generics were not being used. (PR#3536)\n\n    o\tSubsetting data frames did not always correctly detect that\n\tnon-existent columns were specified.\n\n    o\tThere are many more checks for over-running internal buffers,\n\talmost always reporting errors.\n\n    o\tAdded some buffer overflow checking in gram.y.\n\n    o\tInternals for complex assignment did not check that function name\n\twas a symbol, which could cause a segfault.\n\n    o\tFixed bug in S4 methods dispatch that made local variables in the\n\tgeneric visible when executing the body of a method, thus violating\n\tlexical scope.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

(E&amp;OE)\n\n    o   Function getAnywhere() can find non-exported objects, for\n        namespaces or registered methods.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o   The (unimplemented) argument 'white' of parse() is deprecated.\n\n    o   The tkfilefind demo in the tcltk library is deprecated, since\n        it never worked well, and apparently not at all with Tcl/Tk 8.4.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   print.table() used too much white space in some cases in 1.7.0.\n\n    o   selectMethod() failed if `f' was a non-generic and\n        optional=TRUE, and gave a confusing error message if\n        optional=FALSE.\n\n    o   pchisq(*, ncp) and qchisq(*, ncp) work in more cases for large ncp\n        or quantile and give warning or error messages otherwise.\n\n    o   str(x) now also works when x is an &quot;externalptr&quot; (or &quot;weakref&quot;).\n\n    o   rbeta(), rf(), and rt() now support infinite parameter values;\n        other distributions return NaN instead of NA for such.\n\n    o   Redefining a class is now safer if the new definition\n        generates an error (previously some invalid metadata could be\n        left behind).\n\n    o   A number of errors are now caught in setClass() that\n        previously either went unchecked or waited until new() to\n        appear:\n        - classes may not contain themselves, directly or indirectly;\n        - classes appearing either as slots or as superclasses must\n          themselves be defined;\n        - slot names (direct or inherited) must be unique.\n        In related changes, prototype() now works as documented, and is the\n        recommended way to provide prototype objects.\n\n    o   Sorting an ordered factor would return an unordered one.\n        This caused some trouble with panel.superpose (PR#974).\n\n    o   methods() could return duplicates if a method in a namespace\n        was both exported and registered.\n\n    o   The internal zip.unpack() could crash if more than 500 files\n        were to be extracted. (PR#2818)\n\n    o   The &quot;r+&quot; and &quot;r+b&quot; modes of opening file connections disallowed\n        writing.\n\n    o   library() now warns the user if the chosen package name\n        doesn't match the internal package name, and corrects the\n        error. (PR#2816)\n\n    o   qr(LAPACK=TRUE) (and qr for complex arguments) might have failed\n        to pivot for rank-deficient inputs. (PR#2867)\n\n    o   Only re-mapped symbols are exported by regex.o, to avoid\n        problems with embedded R on RedHat 9.\n\n    o   arima() did not set transform.pars to FALSE if AR parameters\n        were fixed, although it claimed to.\n\n    o   pnorm() was slower than necessary in the outer tails in some\n        cases due to a typo in the improvements from PR#699.  (PR#2883)\n\n    o   setGeneric() and setMethod() now catch some examples where the\n        generic and the method have different argument lists; the\n        evaluator checks for internal consistency of these argument lists.\n\n    o   expand.grid(x) {the rare case of one argument} now treats factor\n        levels as in the typical case of two or more arguments.\n\n    o   Some implicit coercions to lists could cause segfaults, e.g.\n          x &lt;- matrix(nrow=20000, ncol=20); x$any &lt;- numeric(0)\n        due to a PROTECT bug. (PR#2923)\n\n    o   The replacement functions for colnames() and rownames() did not\n        work for arrays with more than two dimensions.  They could\n        create dimnames of the form list(NULL, NULL) rather than\n        remove the dimnames attribute.\n\n    o   termplot() gave incorrect answers with rug=TRUE or\n        partial=TRUE for factors whose levels were not in\n        lexicographical order.\n\n    o   A serious performance flaw in as() computations was fixed (the\n        methods were not being cached properly.)\n\n    o   model.frame(~1, data) always returned 1 row. (PR#2958)\n\n    o   The data editor was truncating objects to 65535 rows.  Pro\n        tem, editing objects with more than 65535 rows is an error,\n        and objects cannot be extended beyond that row. This restriction\n        will be removed in 1.8.0.  (PR#2962)\n\n    o   A bug could produce apparent loops in formal method selection\n        when inheritance was restricted (used for the as() function).\n        A related problem sometimes broke attaching a package that had\n        methods for basic functions, such as names(), used in method\n        selection.\n\n    o   Empty expressions as in return(x,) could generate subsequent\n        segfaults: they are now errors.  (PR#2880)\n\n    o   The Kinderman-Ramage Normal Random Generator had several\n        problems leading to not-quite normally distributed variates\n        (PR#2846).  One problem was traced to an error in the original\n        1976 JASA paper!  Thanks to Josef Leydold and his team for\n        investigating this. The old generator has been retained for\n        reproducibility of older results, under the name\n        &quot;Buggy Kinderman-Ramage&quot;.  A warning is issued if you select it\n        (also indirectly via RNGversion()).\n\n    o   promptMethods() now puts the \\alias lines for methods in the\n        normal place, near the top of the file, and quotes class\n         names in signatures.\n\n    o   getS3method() and methods() were not finding methods for\n        coefficients() and fitted.values() (which dispatch on &quot;coef&quot;\n        and &quot;fitted&quot; respectively).\n\n    o   scan() (and hence read.table) was not finding matches for\n        separator chars with the upper bit set.  (PR#3035)\n\n    o   lm.(w)fit failed if the fit had rank 0.\n\n    o   lqs() did not report explicitly that it had failed if all\n        samples gave singular fits.\n\n    o   predict.lm(*, se=TRUE) {w/ weights, w/o newdata} now gives correct\n        SE's.  (PR#3043)\n\n    o   cor.test(x, y, method=&quot;spearman&quot;) now also works for\n        length(x) &gt; 1290.\n\n    o   Matrices were printed mis-aligned if right=TRUE and na.print\n        was specified.  (PR#3058)\n\n    o   R CMD check gives now a clearer message when latex produces\n        errors on the package manual.  (PR#3070)\n\n    o   isSeekable() was incorrectly returning FALSE on all file connections.\n\n    o   tkpager() wasn't quite using its title and header arguments in\n        the way prescribed by file.show()\n\n    o   legend(*, pch=p, lty=l) now works better when `p' or `l' have\n        NAs.\n\n    o   All braces in regular expressions used by Sweave() are now\n        escaped by a backslash.\n\n    o   unloadNamespace() failed because getNamespaceImports() now coerces a\n        string argument to a name space.\n\n    o   deriv3 gave incorrect Hessians for some very simple\n        expressions such as expression(x*y) (since the comments in the\n        C code were incorrect).  (PR#2577)\n\n    o   power.t.test(..., delta=NULL,alternative='two.sided') failed. (PR#2993)\n\n    o   Lines on postscript() plots with thousands of segments might\n        have been plotted inaccurately in 1.7.0. (PR#3132)\n\n        Solid lines in postscript() output are split into groups of 1000\n        segments to help some PostScript interpreters (typically old\n        level-1 interpreters).\n\n    o   cut.POSIXt failed when the breaks were date/time objects. (PR#3181)\n\n    o   Usage of methods in dist.Rd is now correctly documented\n        (as.matrix.dist() is not an exported symbol).\n\n    o   The predict() method for ar fits was not retrieving the series\n        from the parent environment.\n\n    o   eigen() and La.eigen() were not returning a matrix of\n        eigenvectors for a 1x1 input.\n\n    o   hsv() and rgb() now return character(0) when one of their args has\n        length 0.  This also fixes terrain.color(1). (PR#3233)\n\n    o   [[&lt;-.data.frame checked if a replacment was too short, but not\n        if it was too long.  (related to PR#3229)\n\n    o   qt(x, df) was quite inaccurate for df=1+epsilon; it is now much more\n        accurate for df in (1,2) and more precise for other df. (PR#2991)\n\n    o   qbeta() now has slightly improved C code in two places, as suggested\n        in the 2nd followup to PR#2894.\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a new version\nwith major changes in the methods/class area and with namespaces used\nmuch more widely than before. Several routines now use the faster and\nmore modern LAPACK library. Also notice that the underscore is now\nstrongly deprecated as an assignment operator.\n\nThere are also a bunch of new functions and an assortment of bugs have\nbeen fixed.\n\nYou can get it from\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.7.0.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.7.0.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binaries\nfor various platforms will appear in due course.\n \nThere is also a version split for floppies.\n\nThese are the md5sums for the freshly created files, in case you wish\nto check that they are uncorrupted:\n\n292dbe4dc47e6b492ff72a62471654ca  R-1.7.0.tgz\n693d29ea3959f1b862704b59367e4ac1  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.aa\n42b3fa5bc17fc3151eaabd2db0f530ca  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.ab\n3fa95fa9661b6ff3ff33936ca57bdb89  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.ac\nc124f1be4d35676975527bc19efbd579  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.ad\nbb3a82202a8f113abf0260b6b585dc92  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.ae\n84720f839a564abc8255c9a4b8c2980d  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.af\ncfe0314cfc1ceea9ec74d00919e82865  R-1.7.0.tgz-split.ag\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.7.0\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o\tsolve(), chol(), eigen() and svd() now use LAPACK routines\n\tunless a new back-compatibility option is turned on.  The\n\tsigns and normalization of eigen/singular vectors may change\n\tfrom earlier versions.\n\n    o\tThe `methods', `modreg', `mva', `nls' and `ts' packages\n\tare now attached by default at startup (in addition to `ctest').\n\tThe option &quot;defaultPackages&quot; has been added which contains the\n\tinitial list of packages.  See ?Startup and ?options for details.\n\tNote that .First() is no longer used by R itself.\n\n\tclass() now always (not just when `methods' is attached) gives\n\ta non-null class, and UseMethod() always dispatches on the\n\tclass that class() returns.  This means that methods like\n\tfoo.matrix and foo.integer will be used.  Functions oldClass()\n\tand oldClass&lt;-() get and set the &quot;class&quot; attribute as R\n\twithout `methods' used to.\n\n    o\tThe default random number generators have been changed to\n\t`Mersenne-Twister' and `Inversion'.  A new RNGversion()\n\tfunction allows you to restore the generators of an earlier R\n\tversion if reproducibility is required.\n\n    o\tNamespaces can now be defined for packages other than `base':\n\tsee `Writing R Extensions'.  This hides some internal objects\n\tand changes the search path from objects in a namespace.  All\n\tthe base packages (except methods and tcltk) have namespaces,\n\tas well as the recommended packages `KernSmooth', `MASS',\n\t`boot', `class', `nnet', `rpart' and `spatial'.\n\n    o\tFormulae are not longer automatically simplified when terms()\n\tis called, so the formulae in results may still be in the\n\toriginal form rather than the equivalent simplified form\n\t(which may have reordered the terms): the results are now\n\tmuch closer to those of S.\n\n    o\tThe tables for plotmath, Hershey and Japanese have been moved\n\tfrom the help pages (example(plotmath) etc) to demo(plotmath) etc.\n\n    o\tErrors and warnings are sent to stderr not stdout on\n\tcommand-line versions of R (Unix and Windows).\n\n    o\tThe R_X11 module is no longer loaded until it is needed, so\n\tdo test that x11() works in a new Unix-alike R installation.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tif() and while() give a warning if called with a vector condition.\n\n    o\tInstalled packages under Unix without compiled code are no\n\tlonger stamped with the platform and can be copied to other\n\tUnix-alike platforms (but not to other OSes because of\n\tpotential problems with line endings and OS-specific help files).\n\n    o\tThe internal random number generators will now never return\n\tvalues of 0 or 1 for runif.  This might affect simulation\n\toutput in extremely rare cases.\t Note that this is not\n\tguaranteed for user-supplied random-number generators, nor\n\twhen the standalone Rmath library is used.\n\n    o\tWhen assigning names to a vector, a value that is too short is\n\tpadded by character NAs. (Wishlist part of PR#2358)\n\n    o\tIt is now recommended to use the 'SystemRequirements:' field in\n\tthe DESCRIPTION file for specifying dependencies external to the\n\tR system.\n\n    o\tOutput text connections no longer have a line-length limit.\n\n    o\tOn platforms where vsnprintf does not return the needed buffer\n\tsize the output line-length limit for fifo(), gzfile() and\n\tbzfile() has been raised from 10k to 100k chars.\n\n    o\tThe Math group generic does not check the number of arguments\n\tsupplied before dispatch: it used to if the default method had\n\tone argument but not if it had two.  This allows trunc.POSIXt()\n\tto be called via the group generic trunc().\n\n    o\tLogical matrix replacement indexing of data frames is now\n\timplemented (interpreted as if the lhs was a matrix).\n\n    o\tRecursive indexing of lists is allowed, so x[[c(4,2)]] is\n\tshorthand for x[[4]][[2]] etc.\t(Wishlist PR#1588)\n\n    o\tMost of the time series functions now check explicitly for a\n\tnumeric time series, rather than fail at a later stage.\n\n    o\tThe postscript output makes use of relative moves, and so is\n\tsomewhat more compact.\n\n    o\t%*% and crossprod() for complex arguments make use of BLAS\n\troutines and so may be much faster on some platforms.\n\n    o\tarima() has coef(), logLik() (and hence AIC) and vcov() methods.\n\n    o\tNew function as.difftime() for time-interval data.\n\n    o\tbasename() and dirname() are now vectorized.\n\n    o\tbiplot.default() {mva} allows `xlab' and `ylab' parameters to\n\tbe set (without partially matching to `xlabs' and `ylabs').\n\t(Thanks to Uwe Ligges.)\n\n    o\tNew function capture.output() to send printed output from an expression\n\tto a connection or a text string.\n\n    o\tccf() (pckage ts) now coerces its x and y arguments to class &quot;ts&quot;.\n\n    o\tchol() and chol2inv() now use LAPACK routines by default.\n\n    o\tas.dist(.) is now idempotent, i.e., works for &quot;dist&quot; objects.\n\n    o\tGeneric function confint() and `lm' method (formerly in\n\tpackage MASS, which has `glm' and `nls' methods).\n\n    o\tNew function constrOptim() for optimisation under linear inequality\n\tconstraints.\n\n    o\tAdd `difftime' subscript method and methods for the group\n\tgenerics. (Thereby fixing PR#2345)\n\n    o\tdownload.file() can now use HTTP proxies which require `basic'\n\tusername/password authentication.\n\n    o\tdump() has a new argument `envir'.  The search for named\n\tobjects now starts by default in the environment from which\n\tdump() is called.\n\n    o\tThe edit.matrix() and edit.data.frame() editors can now handle\n\tlogical data.\n\n    o\tNew argument `local' for example() (suggested by Andy Liaw).\n\n    o\tNew function file.symlink() to create symbolic file links\n\twhere supported by the OS.\n\n    o\tNew generic function flush() with a method to flush connections.\n\n    o\tNew function force() to force evaluation of a formal argument.\n\n    o\tNew functions getFromNamespace(), fixInNamespace() and\n\tgetS3method() to facilitate developing code in packages with\n\tnamespaces.\n\n    o\tglm() now accepts `etastart' and `mustart' as alternative ways\n\tto express starting values.\n\n    o\tNew function gzcon() which wraps a connection and provides\n\t(de)compression compatible with gzip.\n\n\tload() now uses gzcon(), so can read compressed saves from\n\tsuitable connections.\n\n    o\thelp.search() can now reliably match individual aliases and\n\tkeywords, provided that all packages searched were installed\n\tusing R 1.7.0 or newer.\n\n    o\thist.default() now returns the nominal break points, not those\n\tadjusted for numerical tolerances.\n\n\tTo guard against unthinking use, `include.lowest' in\n\thist.default() is now ignored, with a warning, unless `breaks'\n\tis a vector.  (It either generated an error or had no effect,\n\tdepending how prettification of the range operated.)\n\n    o\tNew generic functions influence(), hatvalues() and dfbeta()\n\twith lm and glm methods; the previously normal functions rstudent(),\n\trstandard(), cooks.distance() and dfbetas() became generic.\n\tThese have changed behavior for glm objects -- all originating from\n\tJohn Fox' car package.\n\n    o\tinteraction.plot() has several new arguments, and the legend\n\tis not clipped anymore by default.  It internally uses axis(1,*)\n\tinstead of mtext().\n\tThis also addresses &quot;bugs&quot; PR#820, PR#1305, PR#1899.\n\n    o\tNew isoreg() function and class for isotonic regression\n\t(`modreg' package).\n\n    o\tLa.chol() and La.chol2inv() now give interpretable error\n\tmessages rather than LAPACK error codes.\n\n    o\tlegend() has a new `plot' argument.  Setting it `FALSE' gives\n\tsize information without plotting (suggested by U.Ligges).\n\n    o\tlibrary() was changed so that when the methods package is\n\tattached it no longer complains about formal generic functions\n\tnot specific to the library.\n\n    o\tlist.files()/dir() have a new argument `recursive'.\n\n    o\tlm.influence() has a new `do.coef' argument allowing *not* to\n\tcompute casewise changed coefficients.\tThis makes plot.lm() much\n\tquicker for large data sets.\n\n    o\tload() now returns invisibly a character vector of the names\n\tof the objects which were restored.\n\n    o\tNew convenience function loadURL() to allow loading data files\n\tfrom URLs (requested by Frank Harrell).\n\n    o\tNew function mapply(), a multivariate lapply().\n\n    o\tNew function md5sum() in package tools to calculate MD5\n\tchecksums on files (e.g. on parts of the R installation).\n\n    o\tmedpolish() {package eda} now has an `na.rm' argument (PR#2298).\n\n    o\tmethods() now looks for registered methods in namespaces, and\n\tknows about many objects that look like methods but are not.\n\n    o\tmosaicplot() has a new default for `main', and supports the\n\t`las' argument (contributed by Uwe Ligges and Wolfram Fischer).\n\n    o\tAn attempt to open() an already open connection will be detected\n\tand ignored with a warning.  This avoids improperly closing\n\tsome types of connections if they are opened repeatedly.\n\n    o\toptim(method = &quot;SANN&quot;) can now cover combinatorial optimization\n\tby supplying a move function as the `gr' argument (contributed\n\tby Adrian Trapletti).\n\n    o\tPDF files produced by pdf() have more extensive information\n\tfields, including the version of R that produced them.\n\n    o\tOn Unix(-alike) systems the default PDF viewer is now determined\n\tduring configuration, and available as the 'pdfviewer' option.\n\n    o\tpie(...) has always accepted graphical pars but only passed\n\tthem on to title().  Now pie(, cex=1.5) works.\n\n    o\tplot.dendrogram (`mva' package) now draws leaf labels if present\n\tby default.\n\n    o\tNew plot.design() function as in S.\n\n    o\tThe postscript() and PDF() drivers now allow the title to be set.\n\n    o\tNew function power.anova.test(), contributed by Claus Ekstr&#248;m.\n\n    o\tpower.t.test() now behaves correctly for negative delta in the\n\ttwo-tailed case.\n\n    o\tpower.t.test() and power.prop.test() now have a `strict'\n\targument that includes rejections in the &quot;wrong tail&quot; in the\n\tpower calculation. (Based in part on code suggested by Ulrich\n\tHalekoh.)\n\n    o\tprcomp() is now fast for n x m inputs with m &gt;&gt; n.\n\n    o\tprincomp() no longer allows the use of more variables than\n\tunits: use prcomp() instead.\n\n    o\tprincomp.formula() now has principal argument `formula', so\n\tupdate() can be used.\n\n    o\tPrinting an object with attributes now dispatches on the\n\tclass(es) of the attributes. See ?print.default for the fine\n\tprint. (PR#2506)\n\n    o\tprint.matrix() and prmatrix() are now separate functions.\n\tprmatrix() is the old S-compatible function, and\n\tprint.matrix() is a proper print method, currently identical\n\tto print.default().  prmatrix() and the old print.matrix()\n\tdid not print attributes of a matrix, but the new print.matrix()\n\tdoes.\n\n    o\tprint.summary.{lm,glm} now default to symbolic.cor = FALSE, but\n\tsymbolic.cor can be passed to the print methods from the\n\tsummary methods.  print.summary.{lm,glm} print correlations to\n\t2 decimal places, and the symbolic printout avoids abbreviating\n\tlabels.\n\n    o\tIf a prompt() method is called with 'filename' as 'NA', a\n\tlist-style representation of the documentation shell generated\n\tis returned.  New function promptData() for documenting objects\n\tas data sets.\n\n    o\tqqnorm() and qqline() have an optional logical argument\n\t`datax' to transpose the plot (S-PLUS compatibility).\n\n    o\tqr() now has the option to use LAPACK routines, and the\n\tresults can be used by the helper routines qr.coef(), qr.qy()\n\tand qr.qty().  The LAPACK-using versions may be much faster\n\tfor large matrices (using an optimized BLAS) but are less\n\tflexible.\n\n    o\tQR objects now have class &quot;qr&quot;, and solve.qr() is now just the\n\tmethod for solve() for the class.\n\n    o\tNew function r2dtable() for generating random samples of two-way\n\ttables with given marginals using Patefield's algorithm.\n\n    o\trchisq() now has a non-centrality parameter `ncp', and there's a\n\tC API for rnchisq().\n\n    o\tNew generic function reorder() with a dendrogram method;\n\tnew order.dendrogram() and heatmap().\n\n    o\trequire() has a new argument, character.only,\n\t  -- to make it align with library.\n\n    o\tNew functions rmultinom() and dmultinom(), the first one with\n\ta C API.\n\n    o\tNew function runmed() for fast runnning medians (`modreg' package).\n\n    o\tNew function slice.index() for identifying indexes with respect\n\tto slices of an array.\n\n    o\tsolve.default(a) now gives the dimnames one would expect.\n\n    o\tstepfun() has a new `right' argument for right-continuous step\n\tfunction construction.\n\n    o\tstr() now shows ordered factors different from unordered ones.\n\tIt also differentiates &quot;NA&quot; and as.character(NA), also for factor\n\tlevels.\n\n    o\tsymnum() has a new logical argument `abbr.colnames'.\n\n    o\tsummary(&lt;logical&gt;) now mentions NA's as suggested by\n\tG&#246;ran Brostr&#246;m.\n\n    o\tsummaryRprof() now prints times with a precision appropriate\n\tto the sampling interval, rather than always to 2dp.\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.getpid() to get the process ID of the R session.\n\n    o\ttable() now allows exclude= with factor arguments (requested by\n\tMichael Friendly).\n\n    o\tThe tempfile() function now takes an optional second argument\n\tgiving the directory name.\n\n    o\tThe ordering of terms for terms.formula(keep.order=FALSE) is\n\tnow defined on the help page and used consistently, so that\n\trepeated calls will not alter the ordering (which is why\n\tdelete.response() was failing: see the bug fixes).  The\n\tformula is not simplified unless the new argument `simplify'\n\tis true.\n\n    o\tadded &quot;[&quot; method for terms objects.\n\n    o\tNew argument `silent' to try().\n\n    o\tts() now allows arbitrary values for y in start/end = c(x, y):\n\tit always allowed y &lt; 1 but objected to y &gt; frequency.\n\n    o\tunique.default() now works for POSIXct objects, and hence so\n\tdoes factor().\n\n\n    o\tPackage tcltk now allows return values from the R side to the\n\tTcl side in callbacks and the R_eval command. If the return\n\tvalue from the R function or expression is of class &quot;tclObj&quot;\n\tthen it will be returned to Tcl.\n\n    o\tA new HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL graphical user interface using the tcltk\n\tpackage is provided. Currently, little more than a proof of concept.\n\tIt can be started by calling &quot;R -g Tk&quot; (this may change in later\n\tversions) or by evaluating tkStartGUI(). Only Unix-like systems\n\tfor now. It is not too stable at this point; in particular, signal\n\thandling is not working properly.\n\n\n    o\tChanges to support name spaces:\n\n\t- Placing base in a name space can no longer be disabled by\n\t  defining the environment variable R_NO_BASE_NAMESPACE.\n\n\t- New function topenv() to determine the nearest top level\n\t  environment (usually .GlobalEnv or a name space environment).\n\n\t- Added name space support for packages that do not use methods.\n\n    o\tFormal classes and methods can be `sealed', by using the\n\tcorresponding argument to setClass or setMethod.  New\n\tfunctions isSealedClass() and isSealedMethod() test sealing.\n\n    o\tpackages can now be loaded with version numbers. This allows\n\tfor multiple versions of files to be installed (and potentially\n\tloaded). Some serious testing will be going on, but it should\n\thave no effect unless specifically asked for.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tTITLE files in packages are no longer used, the Title field\n\tin the DESCRIPTION file being preferred.  TITLE files will be\n\tignored in both installed packages and source packages.\n\n    o\tWhen searching for a Fortran 77 compiler, configure by default\n\tnow also looks for Fujitsu's frt and Compaq's fort, but no\n\tlonger for cf77 and cft77.\n\n    o\tConfigure checks that mixed C/Fortran code can be run before\n\tchecking compatibility on ints and doubles: the latter test\n\twas sometimes failing because the Fortran libraries were not\n\tfound.\n\n    o\tPCRE and bzip2 are built from versions in the R sources if the\n\tappropriate library is not found.\n\n    o\tNew configure option --with-lapack to allow high-performance\n\tLAPACK libraries to be used: a generic LAPACK library will be\n\tused if found.\tThis option is not the default.\n\n    o\tNew configure options --with-libpng, --with-jpeglib, --with-zlib,\n\t--with-bzlib and --with-pcre, principally to allow these\n\tlibraries to be avoided if they are unsuitable.\n\n    o\tIf the precious variable R_BROWSER is set at configure time\n\tit overrides the automatic selection of the default browser.\n\tIt should be set to the full path unless the browser appears\n\tat different locations on different client machines.\n\n    o\tPerl requirements are down again to 5.004 or newer.\n\n    o\tAutoconf 2.57 or later is required to build the configure\n\tscript.\n\n    o\tConfigure provides a more comprehensive summary of its results.\n\n    o\tIndex generation now happens when installing source packages\n\tusing R code in package tools.\tAn existing 'INDEX' file is used\n\tas is; otherwise, it is automatically generated from the \\name\n\tand \\title entries in the Rd files.  Data, demo and vignette\n\tindices are computed from all available files of the respective\n\tkind, and the corresponding index information (in the Rd files,\n\tthe 'demo/00Index' file, and the \\VignetteIndexEntry{} entries,\n\trespectively).\tThese index files, as well as the package Rd\n\tcontents data base, are serialized as R objects in the 'Meta'\n\tsubdirectory of the top-level package directory, allowing for\n\tfaster and more reliable index-based computations (e.g., in\n\thelp.search()).\n\n    o\tThe Rd contents data base is now computed when installing source\n\tpackages using R code in package tools.\t The information is\n\trepresented as a data frame without collapsing the aliases and\n\tkeywords, and serialized as an R object.  (The 'CONTENTS' file\n\tin Debian Control Format is still written, as it is used by the\n\tHTML search engine.)\n\n    o\tA NAMESPACE file in root directory of a source package is copied\n\tto the root of the package installation directory.  Attempting to\n\tinstall a package with a NAMESPACE file using --save signals an\n\terror; this is a temporary measure.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\tThe assignment operator `_' will be removed in the next\n\trelease and users are now warned on every usage: you may even see\n\tmultiple warnings for each usage.\n\n\tIf environment variable R_NO_UNDERLINE is set to anything of\n\tpositive length then use of `_' becomes a syntax error.\n\n    o\tmachine(), Machine() and Platform() are defunct.\n\n    o\trestart() is defunct.  Use try(), as has long been recommended.\n\n    o\tThe deprecated arguments `pkg' and `lib' of system.file() have\n\tbeen removed.\n\n    o\tprintNoClass() {methods} is deprecated (and moved to base,\n\tsince it was a copy of a base function).\n\n    o\tPrimitives dataClass() and objWithClass() have been replaced\n\tby class() and class&lt;-(); they were internal support functions\n\tfor use by package methods.\n\n    o\tThe use of SIGUSR2 to quit a running R process under Unix is\n\tdeprecated, the signal may need to be reclaimed for other\n\tpurposes.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tR CMD check more compactly displays the tests of DESCRIPTION\n\tmeta-information.  It now reports demos and vignettes without\n\tavailable index information.  Unless installation tests are\n\tskipped, checking is aborted if the package dependencies cannot\n\tbe resolved at run time.  Rd files are now also explicitly\n\tchecked for empty \\name and \\title entries.  The examples are\n\talways run with T and F redefined to give an error if used\n\tinstead of TRUE and FALSE.\n\n    o\tThe Perl code to build help now removes an existing example\n\tfile if there are no examples in the current help file.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rdindex is now deprecated in favor of function Rdindex()\n\tin package tools.\n\n    o\tSweave() now encloses the Sinput and Soutput environments of\n\teach chunk in an Schunk environment. This allows to fix some\n\tvertical spacing problems when using the latex class slides.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tA full double-precision LAPACK shared library is made\n\tavailable as -lRlapack.\t To use this include\n\t$(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) in PKG_LIBS.\n\n    o\tHeader file R_ext/Lapack.h added.  C declarations of BLAS\n\troutines moved to R_ext/BLAS.h and included in R_ext/Applic.h\n\tand R_ext/Linpack.h for backward compatibility.\n\n    o\tR will automatically call initialization and unload routines, if\n\tpresent, in shared libraries/DLLs during dyn.load() and\n\tdyn.unload() calls. The routines are named R_init_&lt;dll name&gt;\n\tand R_unload_&lt;dll name&gt;, respectively.\tSee the Writing R\n\tExtensions Manual for more information.\n\n    o\tRoutines exported directly from the R executable for use with\n\t.C(), .Call(), .Fortran() and .External() are now accessed via\n\tthe registration mechanism (optionally) used by packages.  The\n\tROUTINES file (in src/appl/) and associated scripts to\n\tgenerate FFTab.h and FFDecl.h are no longer used.\n\n    o\tEntry point Rf_append is no longer in the installed headers\n\t(but is still available).  It is apparently unused.\n\n    o\tMany conflicts between other headers and R's can be avoided by\n\tdefining STRICT_R_HEADERS and/or R_NO_REMAP -- see `Writing R\n\tExtensions' for details.\n\n    o\tNew entry point R_GetX11Image and formerly undocumented\n\tptr_R_GetX11Image are in new header R_ext/GetX11Image.\tThese\n\tare used by package tkrplot.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tSys.sleep() on Unix was having trouble with waits of less than 0.5s\n\n    o\tThe fix to PR#2396 broke read.table() on files with CR line\n\tendings. (PR#2469)   Separate problem with this on Carbon MacOS\n\tbuild fixed as well.\n\n    o\tConverting Sweave files to noweb syntax using SweaveSyntConv()\n\twas broken.\n\n    o\tPrinting numbers near the minimum could get the number of\n\tsignificant figures wrong due to underflow: for example 4e-308\n\tmight print as 4.00000e-308.  (Seen on some Windows builds,\n\tand also on numbers around 1e-317 on Linux.)\n\n    o\twilcox.test() could give integer overflow warnings on very long\n\tvectors.  Also added tests for numeric inputs, as per the help\n\tpage.  (PR#2453)\n\n    o\tPrinting unquoted character vectors containing escape\n\tcharacters was computing the wrong length and hence\n\tmisaligning names.  This was due to a bug in Rstrlen which\n\tmight have had other effects.\n\n    o\tif(logical(0)) and while(logical(0)) now report zero length,\n\tnot `missing value where logical is needed'.\n\n    o\tThe gaussian() and inverse.gaussian() families were documented\n\tto allow only one link, which has not been true in R for at\n\tleast four years.\n\n    o\tprmatrix() forced conversion to character if `na.print' was\n\tused, and that conversion neither respected `digits' nor\n\t`quote'.\n\n    o\tRprof() might give misleading results for too small values of\n\t`interval' and in practice the default 20ms was about as small\n\tas is advisable on Linux.  Now the interval is forced to be at\n\tleast one clock tick.\n\n    o\tsummary.data.frame() was not giving interpretable results when\n\tthe data frame contained a data frame as a column. (PR#1891)\n\n    o\tdelete.response() might re-order the rhs terms so prediction\n\tmight fail or even give incorrect results. (PR#2206)\n\n    o\tStructTS() now accepts numeric time series of integer storage mode.\n\n    o\tall(), any() now handle NAs as documented.\n\n    o\tSubsetting arrays to a result with 0 dimension(s) failed if\n\tthe array had dimnames. (PR#2507)\n\n    o\tIf the call to data.frame() included 0-row arguments, it tried\n\tto replicate them to the maximum number of rows, and failed if\n\tthis was 1 or more.\n\n    o\treplicate() now understands data frames to which na.omit() has\n\tbeen applied.\n\n    o\tis.ts() was too liberal: a time series must have at least one point.\n\n    o\tmethods() was sorting by package, not by name.\n\n    o\tsymbols(thermometers=) was often giving a spurious warning about\n\tthe range.\n\n    o\ttcltk was using deprecated internals of the Tcl library when\n\taccessing error messages.  Not likely to be a user-visible\n\tchange.\n\n    o\tThe automatic search for BLAS libs now tries Sun's libsunperf\n\tthe way the latest versions require. (PR#2530)\n\n    o\tstr(array(1)) now does show the array.\n\tstr(Surv(...)) now works again.\n\n    o\tstep(), add1.default() and drop1.default() now work somewhat\n\tbetter if called from a function.\n\n    o\tpage() was searching from the wrong environment, and so\n\tsearching base before the workspace.\n\n    o\tcrossprod(Z) for complex Z was returning nonsense.\n\n    o\tLa.chol2inv() gave incorrect results unless the matrix was square.\n\n    o\tWhen the POSIXt date functions were required to guess DST,\n\tthey sometimes guessed correctly that DST was in force but\n\tconverted a POSIXlt time as if standard time was given.\n\n    o\tc/rbind were not handling zero col/row matrices correctly.\n\t(PR#2541 was one symptom.)\n\n    o\tapprox() and approxfun() now work with 1 knot if\n\tmethod = &quot;constant&quot;.  stepfun(), ecdf() and plot.stepfun() do so\n\tas well.\n\n    o\tAIC.lm/default was failing if multiple objects and k were\n\tspecified.  (PR#2518)\n\n    o\tremoveMethods{methods} was broken. (PR#2519)\n\n    o\tsummary.glm() had two `aic' components in the returned object.\n\n    o\tautoload() was returning the value of its last command, a\n\tpromise, even though it was documented to have no value.\n\tAs a result some packages (e.g. nlme) were loading packages\n\tthey meant to autoload.\n\n    o\tFixes to methods and classes:\n\t   - show() is consistent with using setOldClass for S3 classes.\n\t   - several problems with the coerce and replace methods\n\t     generated by setIs have been fixed.\n\t   - more thorough tests &amp; informative messages for invalid\n\t     `def' arguments to setGeneric\n\t   - setGeneric will now create the generic function even when\n\t     a generic of the same name already exists (it does issue\n\t     a warning).\n\n    o\tunz() connections could no longer be opened. (PR#2579)\n\n    o\tunique(ordered factor) returned an unordered factor. (PR#2591)\n\n    o\tx[] &lt;- value coerced x to the mode of value if and only if x\n\thad length 0!  (Should only happen if x is null: PR#2590)\n\n    o\tlm() mislabelled the cols of the qr decomposition. (cause of PR#2586)\n\n    o\tdata() looks for file extensions in an order prescribed in the\n\thelp file: previously whether foo.R or foo.csv was used was\n\tlocale-dependent.\n\n    o\tsys.function() now returns the actual function being evaluated in\n\tthe specified frame rather than one inferred from the call.\n\n    o\tmatch.call() now uses the definition of the actual function being\n\tevaluated rather than one inferred from the call.\n\n    o\tabbreviate(*, dot = TRUE) now only adds a &quot;.&quot; where abbreviations\n\tdid happen.\n\n    o\tChanging timezones in the POSIXt functions was not working on\n\tsome Linux systems, and this has been corrected.\n\n    o\tks.test() in package ctest had numerical problems in the lower\n\ttail of the asymptotic distribution (PR#2571).\n\n    o\tSweave() now handles empty chunks at the end of files correctly.\n\n    o\t[&lt;-() lost the object bit if coercion was involved.\n\n    o\tpackage::object wasn't being deparsed properly.\n\n    o\tseq.POSIXt() with `by' an object of class &quot;difftime&quot; ignored\n\tthe units.\n\n    o\trank(c(&quot;B&quot;, NA)) no longer returns character.\n\n    o\treference to by() added in ?tapply\n\n    o\t?lm describes what happens with matrix response\n\n    o\tThe X11 device has improved event handling. In particular it\n\tused to often miss the last of a series of resize events.\n\n    o\tlm.influence() and related functions now work again for the\n\tmultivariate case and when there are zero weights.\n\n    o\tformat( &lt;character&gt; ) now always keeps names and dimnames.\n\n    o\ttable(factor(c(2,NA), exclude=NULL)) prints better now.\n\n    o\tpredict(foo, type = &quot;terms&quot;) and hence\n\tresiduals(foo, type = &quot;partial&quot;) now work for lm and glm objects\n\twith weights zero.  Further, model.matrix() is now only called once.\n\n    o\tR CMD config now works correctly when called from a Makefile\n\tusing GNU make.\n\n    o\tThe data.frame method for rbind() was\n\t- converting character columns to factors,\n\t- converting ordered factor columns to unordered factors,\n\t- failing to append correctly a factor to a character column\n\t  and vice versa.\n\n    o\tas.hclust.twins() now does provide proper `labels', `method' and\n\t`call' components.\n\n    o\tcycle() sometimes failed on a time series which started at a cycle\n\tother than 1.\n\n    o\tread.dcf() read incorrectly files which did not end in a new line.\n\n    o   read.socket() dropped certain non-alphanumeric characters. (PR#2639)\n\n    o   termplot() handles missing data better (PR#2687, \n         &lt;<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">Mark.Bravington at csiro.au</A>&gt;)\n\n    o\tCorrected MacRoman encoding for Icircumflex etc.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

It is now possible to draw big DEMs.\n\n    o   logLik.nls() gave wrong df. (PR#2295)\n\n    o   rbind() with a mixture of data frames and matrices treated the\n        matrices as vectors. (PR#2266)\n\n    o   stripchart(method=&quot;stack&quot;) was not handling missing values. (PR#2018)\n\n    o   Arithmetic functions such as log() lost the object bit from\n        classed objects if coercion was needed. (PR#2315)\n\n    o   exp_rand would go into an infinite loop if unif_rand returned 0.\n\n    o   formatC(x, format=&quot;fg&quot;) could return exponential format if\n        rounding pushed x over a positive power of 10. (PR#2299)\n\n    o   attr(x, foo) used partial matching for `foo' (even though not\n        documented to do so), and failed to find `foo' if there were\n        two or more partial matches before the exact match in the list\n        of attributes.\n\n    o   Rdconv now creates direct HTML hyperlinks when linking to\n        documentation in the same package.  The code now ensures that\n        links which can be resolved within the package are so resolved,\n        even when there are possible resolutions in other packages.\n\n    o   If readBin(what=character()) is used incorrectly on a file which\n        does not contain C-style character strings, warnings (usually\n        many) are now given.\n\n    o   Building libR.so with the zlib in the R sources was not\n        finding the local zlib headers.\n\n    o   system(intern=TRUE) has an undocumented line length limit of\n        119 chars both on Unix and Windows.  The limit is now 8096 and\n        documented.  On Unix (only) every 120th character used to be\n        discarded.\n\n    o   plot.POSIX[cl]t were not passing graphics parameters on to\n        axis.POSIXct.\n\n    o   On some HP-UX systems, installed scripts were not executable\n        when using the BSD-compatible install system program found by\n        configure.  We now always use install-sh on HP-UX. (PR#2091)\n\n    o   c() was converting NA names to &quot;NA&quot;: now proper NA strings are\n        used wherever possible.

This is a minor upgrade,\nfixing an assortment of minor bugs, and one major one: 1.6.0\nintroduced a memory leak in deparsing, causing much trouble for people\nrunning simulations.\n\nYou can get it from the developer site at\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.6.1.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.6.1.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for\nvarious platforms will appear in due course.\n \nThere is also a version split for floppies, but due to the inclusion\nof recommended packages as binary .tar.gz files, I'm no longer\nproviding a patch file.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.6.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   Added a few &quot;trivial and obviously missing&quot; functions to tcltk:\n        tkchooseDirectory, tkpopup, tkdialog, tkread\n\n    o   barplot() has a new argument `axis.lty', which if set to 1\n        allows the pre-1.6.0 behaviour of plotting the axis and tick\n        marks for the categorical axis.  (This was apparently not\n        intentional, but axis() used to ignore lty=0.)\n        The argument `border' is no longer &quot;.NotYetUsed&quot;.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   hist(&lt;datetime&gt;, cex.axis = f)  now works for x-axis too.\n\n    o   prompt() gave wrong \\usage{.} for long argument default expressions.\n\n    o   summary(x) gives more information when `x' is a logical\n        (or a data frame with a logical column which is now quite customary).\n\n    o   seq.POSIXt(from, to, length.out= . ) could give too long results\n\n    o   summaryRprof() was counting nested calls to the same function\n        twice.\n\n    o   Printing of objects of mode &quot;expression&quot; did strange things if\n        there were &quot;%&quot; characters in the deparsed expression (PR#2120).\n\n    o   as.matrix.data.frame converted missings to &quot;NA&quot; not character NA.\n        (PR#2130)\n\n    o   spec.pgram() was only interpolating zero freq for one series. (PR#2123)\n\n    o   help(randu) had % unescaped in the example. (PR#2141)\n\n    o   Making html links would fail if packages-head.html was not\n        writeable. (PR#2133)\n\n    o   Sweave.sty was not installed to $R_HOME/share/texmf when\n        builddir != srcdir. On Windows backslashes in latex paths have\n        to be replaced by slashes.\n\n    o   A memory leak in deparsing was introduced when eliminating\n        static variables (thanks to Achim Zeileis for spotting this).\n        A similar problem in loading workspaces has been corrected.\n\n    o   TclInterface.Rd incorrectly used \\synopsis for \\usage so that\n        the usage section wasn't output.\n\n    o   Readline stack off-by-one error. (PR#2165)\n\n    o   R_ExpandFileName had a memory leak in the case libreadline was\n        used under Unix-alikes.\n\n    o   sys.save.image() now closes all connections so it will work even\n        if the connection list has become full.\n\n    o   loess() had an unstated limit of four predictors: this is now\n        documented and enforced.\n\n    o   ${R_HOME}/etc/Renviron.site is now not read if R_ENVIRON is\n        set, as documented.  Previously it was read unless R_ENVIRON\n        pointed to an actual file.\n\n    o   Startup.Rd described the proceesing under Unix-alikes but\n        incorrectly implied it happened that way on the Windows and\n        MacOS ports.  Neither use Renviron.site, for example.\n\n    o   besselK(x,*) now returns 0 instead of Inf for large x. (PR#2179)\n\n    o   The Tcl console code didn't work with Tcl/TK 8.0, and has been\n        #ifdef'd out.  (PR#2090)\n\n    o   format.AsIs() was not handling matrices.\n\n    o   sd() was not passing na.rm to var() for matrices and data frames.\n\n    o   dist() {mva} silently treated +/-Inf as NA.\n\n    o   setwd() now returns NULL invisibly.\n\n    o   basename() and dirname() did not check the length of their\n        input and ignored elements after the first.  This affected\n        undoc {tools}.\n\n    o   If A had dimnames, eigen(A) had inappropriate dimnames. (PR#2116)\n\n    o   as.POSIXct.dates had a sign error for the origin (PR#2222)\n\n    o   The claim that pie charts should be avoiden (in pie.Rd) is now\n        supported by a quote from Cleveland (1985).\n\n    o   The vsnprintf() functions supplied for systems that don't\n        supply their own had a bug in the output of fractional parts,\n        corrupting data if using save() with ascii=TRUE. (PR#2144)\n\n    o   pretty() values close to 0 in some cases which are now 0 (PR#1032\n        and D.Brahm's mails).\n\n\nBUILD ISSUES\n\n    o   Toplevel Makefile was missing dependency of &quot;docs&quot; on &quot;R&quot; (causing\n        parallel makes to go wrong)\n\n    o   When building with recommended packages those were installed\n        into the first path in R_LIBS, if the environment variable was\n        present.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

You may wish to\nconsult <A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org/160update.txt.\">http://developer.r-project.org/160update.txt.</A>\n\nWe no longer ship the set of recommended packages separately, but\nbundle them up with the main distribution.

Binaries for\nvarious platforms will appear in due course. (Notice that the machine\nwhich hosts cvs.r-project.org had a hardware problem last week, so the\nservice may be slightly unreliable. Unfortunately, this also affects\nsome CRAN mirrors since they are redirected through the same machine.)\n\nThere is also a version split for floppies.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.6.0\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe default colour palette now has &quot;grey&quot; instead of &quot;white&quot;\n\tin location 8.\tSee palette().\n\n    o\tgrid(nx) behaves differently (but the same as in R versions &lt;= 0.64).\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tNew operator :: in the grammar, for name spaces.\n\n    o\tNew faster rowsum(), also works on data frames.\n\n    o\tgrep(), (g)sub() and regexpr() have a new argument `perl'\n\twhich if TRUE uses Perl-style regexps from PCRE (if installed).\n\tNew capabilities option &quot;PCRE&quot; to say if PCRE is available.\n\n    o\tPreparations for name space support:\n\n\t- Functions in the base package are now defined in a name space.\n\t  As a temporary measure, you can disable this by defining the\n\t  environment variable R_NO_BASE_NAMESPACE.\n\n\t- UseMethod dispatching now searches for methods in the\n\t  environment of the caller of the generic function rather\n\t  than the environment where the generic is defined.\n\n    o\tThe objects created in the methods package to represent\n\tclasses, generic functions, method definitions, and\n\tinheritance relations now themselves belong to true classes.  In\n\tparticular, the &quot;classRepresentation&quot; objects follow the description\n\tin &quot;Programming with Data&quot; (section 7.6).\n\n    o\tOther additions and changes to the methods package:\n\n\t- The function setOldClass() has been added, following the\n\t  description on page 450 of &quot;Programming with Data&quot;.  Use it\n\t  if old-style classes are to be supplied in signatures for\n\t  setMethod, particularly if the old-style classes have\n\t  inheritance.\tMany of the old-style classes in the base\n\t  package should be pre-specified; try getClass(&quot;mlm&quot;), e.g.\n\n\t- The setGeneric() function applies some heuristics to warn\n\t  about possibly erroneous generic function definitions.\n\t  (Before, obscure bugs could result.)\n\n\t- The function promptMethods() has been revised to work better\n\t  and to provide aliases for individual methods.\n\n\t- The behavior of the as() function has been generalized, in\n\t  particular with a strict= argument, the general goal being\n\t  to let simple extensions of classes pass through in method\n\t  dispatch and related computations without altering the\n\t  objects. More to make method behavior more &quot;natural&quot; than\n\t  for direct use.\n\n\t- Some inconsistencies following detach(&quot;package:methods&quot;)\n\t  have been removed, so it _should_ be possible to\n\t  detach/re-attach the methods package.\n\n    o\tNew methods ([[, print, str) and extended plot() method\n\t(incl. logical `horiz') for &quot;dendrogram&quot; class.\n\n    o\tsprintf() now checks the agreement between formats and object\n\ttypes, and handles special values (NA, Inf, ...) correctly.\n\n    o\tchol() now uses a tolerance for non-positive-definiteness and\n\tso should give more consistent results across platforms.\n\n    o\tNew function agrep() for approximate (fuzzy) string matching.\n\n    o\thelp.search() can now use both approximate (fuzzy) and regular\n\texpression matching.  By default, if the pattern to be matched\n\tconsists of only alphanumeric characters, whitespace or a dash,\n\tapproximate matching is used.\n\n    o\taxis() has three new optional arguments `col', `lty', and `lwd'\n\tall for drawing the axis line and tick marks.\n\n    o\tFunction vcov() (formerly in MASS), a generic function to\n\treturn the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter\n\testimates of a fitted model.\n\n    o\tduplicated() and unique() have methods for matrices and arrays\n\t(based on ideas from Jens Oehlschl&#228;gel).\n\n    o\tInternally memory sizes and counts of cons cells are now stored\n\tin unsigned longs.  This allows memory limits to be set and\n\tobjects created in the range 2-4Gb on 32-bit platforms, and\n\tallows 64-bit platforms to use much larger amounts of memory.\n\n    o\tCommand-line flags to set memory can now use the suffix `G'\n\tfor gigabytes.\tThe setting of maximum vsize is now only\n\tlimited by the platform's address space.\n\n    o\tAll warning and error messages are truncated to a length set\n\tby options(warning.length=), defaulting to 1000.  (Previously\n\tmost (but not quite all) were truncated at 8192 characters.)\n\n    o\t[dpqr]gamma() check for shape parameter &gt; 0.\n\n    o\tas.POSIX[cl]t can now convert logical NAs.\n\n    o\tAll installed packages (even those shipped with R) are\n\tgiven a `Built' field in the DESCRIPTION file.\n\n    o\tas.data.frame() now coerces logical matrices into logical\n\tcolumns (rather than factors).\n\n    o\t[[&lt;-.data.frame no longer coerces character replacement values\n\tto factor.  This is consistent with using $ to replace and\n\twith S4.\n\n    o\tlibrary() attempts to detect improperly installed packages, so\n\tas from this version an installed package must have a\n\tDESCRIPTION file and that file must have been stamped with a\n\t`Built:' line (which was introduced in 1.2.0).\tUnder\n\tUnix-alikes, the platform is checked against that used for\n\tinstallation.\n\n    o\tprint.factor() has new arguments `max.levels' (with a smart default)\n\tand `width'.  print.ordered() is no longer needed.\n\n    o\tRNGkind() has an additional option for normal random generators:\n\t&quot;Inversion&quot;.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() recycles factors and &quot;AsIs&quot; objects as well as\n\tatomic vectors.\n\n    o\tpredict.lm() warns if `newdata' is supplied and the fit was\n\trank-deficient, as this can be misleading.\n\n    o\trect() accepts additional graphics parameters through a ...\n\targument (in the same way as polygon).\n\n    o\tstrwidth/strheight() now coerce their first argument in exactly\n\tthe same way text() does, so a wider range of inputs is allowed.\n\n    o\tprompt()'s default and data.frame methods have a new 3rd argument\n\t`name' allowing them to used more easily in scripts and loops.\n\n    o\trgb() has a new `maxColorValue' argument, allowing r,g,b in [0,M],\n\tparticularly in {0:255}, efficiently and non-error-prone.\n\n    o\tsummaryRprof() provides the functionality of R CMD Rprof in R\n\tcode, though more slowly.\n\n    o\tstop() accepts multiple arguments (which are concatenated)\n\tjust as warning() does.\n\n    o\tscan() now throws an error with incorrect logical input (which\n\twas previously taken as FALSE).\n\n    o\tpdf() now uses PDF not R code for clipping, which ensures that\n\tpartially visible text strings are (partially) shown.\n\n    o\tEach R session uses a per-session temporary directory which\n\tis removed at normal termination.  The directory name is given\n\tby the tempdir() function, and filenames returned by\n\ttempfile() will be within that directory.\n\n    o\thelp.start() on Unix now uses a .R subdirectory of the\n\tper-session temporary directory and not ~/.R.  A side effect\n\tis that ~/.R is now never deleted by R.\n\n\tThis now uses the remote control mechanism only if the X\n\tdisplay is local to the R process (as otherwise it might use a\n\tbrowser running on an arbitrary machine).\n\n    o\t*Very* experimental browseEnv() for browsing objects in an\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tcbind/rbind() used to ignore all zero-length vectors, an\n\tundocumented quirk for S-compatibility.\t This caused problems\n\twhen combining zero-extent matrices and zero-length vectors, and\n\tnow zero-length vectors are ignored unless the result would\n\thave zero rows/columns.\n\n    o\tread.table(stdin()) will now work.\n\n    o\tplot.spec(x) now also works for other x than AR and Pgram results.\n\n    o\tNew functions La.chol() and La.chol2inv() for Cholesky\n\tdecomposition and inverse of positive definite matrices using\n\tLapack.\n\n    o\tChanges to the tcltk package\n\n\t- on Unix systems, the Tcl event loop has been integrated with\n\t  R's own (so that tkwait.variable() no longer halts updates of\n\t  plot windows).\n\n\t- also on Unix, stubs have been created to divert R's input\n\t  and output routines to go via Tcl commands. (Nothing\n\t  uses this at present, but packages might be developed to\n\t  take advantage of it.)\n\n\t- return value from Tcl commands is no longer invisible. A new\n\t  print method, print.tclObj(), has been introduced.\n\n\t- Tcl variables created by tclVar() are now explicitly put into\n\t  Tcl's global namespace, removing potential scoping problems.\n\n\t- The tcltk dynamic library now loads with local=FALSE since\n\t  the default had trouble when loading Tcl extensions\n\t  (e.g. Tix)\n\n\t- The tkpager() function had not been updated for the return\n\t  value change from 1.5.0\n\n    o\tThe bmp(), jpeg() and png() devices can produce multiple\n\tbitmap files, one for each page.  The default filenames have been\n\tchanged to include a sequence number.\n\n    o\tNew function axTicks() returning tick mark locations like axis().\n\n    o\tgrid() has a more sensible default behavior.  Tick axis alignment\n\tonly happens when no numbers of grid cells are specified.

Further,\n\tafter par(tcl= &lt;.&gt;), highlevel graphic setting of tcl didn't work\n\tanymore.  &quot;tck&quot; has now S's default of -0.01 (when tcl=NA).\n\n    o\tdata() was not checking if ./data was a directory before\n\twarning.\n\n    o\tAssignment beyond the end of character strings was filling\n\twith &quot;&quot;, whereas changing the length extended with NA_STRING.\n\tNow NA_STRING is used for both.\n\n    o\tboxplot()s with logarithmic scale in &quot;width-direction&quot; now have\n\tproper widths, i.e. typically constant.\n\n    o\tUsing GNU readline in asynchronous event callbacks (e.g. TclTk\n\tor Gtk) works correctly, i.e. doesn't cause readline to abort\n\tthe process.\n\n    o\tUsing Q to exit a browser invoked at the top-level could lead to\n\tthe browser being invoked on all future top-level loops (PR#1721)\n\n    o\tstep(fit, direction=&quot;both&quot;) now uses both directions even if\n\tno scope is supplied.\n\n    o\tstrwidth(), strheight() now give 0 on NA strings (as they\n\tare no longer plotted). (PR#1739)\n\n    o\tmtext(), persp(), plot.hclust() and title() no longer plot NA\n\tcharacter strings.\n\n    o\tpdf() has been protected against the user who specified\n\tnon-existent fonts. (PR#1748)\n\n    o\tdlnorm() returns zero for negative x argument. (PR#1781)\n\n    o\tPrinting 0 in octmode gave &quot;&quot; not &quot;0&quot;. (PR#1759)\n\n    o\tanova.glm() was ignoring a `dispersion' argument if given\n\tmultiple objects. (PR#1807)\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix() with a `rhs ~ .' formula included columns with\n\tduplicated names in the data frame, which caused subsequent\n\tconfusion (e.g. in prediction from the object).\n\n\tmodel.matrix() was sometimes incorrectly determining the first\n\tfactor in a formula without an intercept.\n\n    o\ttermplot() now needs data= argument more rarely.

(PR1809)\n\n    o\tloess() was not checking for too small a span (so no points\n\twere included in the smoothing window).\n\n    o\tmatch() was assuming that there was only one possible bit\n\tpattern for a numeric NA, so some matches failed on Solaris\n\tunder some compiler options.\n\n    o\tidentical() no longer thinks NaN and as.double(NA) are identical.\n\n    o\tpipe() can open in a binary mode even on Linux (where popen\n\tcannot).\n\n    o\tzero-column matrices were not being printed at all, not even\n\tthe row names.\n\n    o\tpolygon()'s `border' argument was incorrectly documented: in\n\tparticular `border = 0' plots in background colour.\n\n    o\tdelete.response() was losing the attribute set for safe\n\tprediction. (PR#1840)\n\n    o\tpoly() was checking the degree against the number of points\n\teven when predicting.\n\n    o\tComparison of a data frame and list failed due to typo.

(PR#1913, 1981)\n\n    o\tsource() would crash if the `keep.source = TRUE' and the input\n\tcontained a function with a line longer than 1024 chars. (PR#1900)\n\n\tThe limits on nesting of functions and on total function size\n\twhen the source is kept are now enforced.  As (incorrectly)\n\tthe source was always kept, this meant functions longer than\n\t128Kb could crash R, even in packages.\n\n    o\tlqs() and cov.rob() check that the quantile argument does not\n\texceed n-1.\n\n    o\tgrid() now also works with log coordinates active.\n\n    o\tplot.table(tab, xlab=&quot;X&quot;, ylab=&quot;Y&quot;) now works as expected.\n\n    o\tplot.formula(ask=FALSE) now works. (PR#1923)\n\n    o\tas.list(&lt;logical&gt;) now works properly. (PR#1926).\n\n    o\tThe residual SSq printed from an aov() fit with weights is\n\tnow the weighted SSq.  (PR#1930)\n\n    o\taov() could still fail on multistrata models with very long\n\tError formulae.\n\n    o\ttry() could fail in BATCH use due to use of fflush(stdin).\n\tOnly seen on Solaris. (PR#1934)\n\n   o\ttitle(main=list(&quot;main&quot;)) printed garbage, as did similar calls\n\tusing quote() instead of expression() for plotmath. (PR#1939)\n\n   o\tdeparse() dropped parentheses in some case where they were\n\tneeded. (PR#1119, 1737, 1928, at least)\n\n   o\tpdf(onefile = FALSE) never incremented the file number beyond\n\ttwo.\n\n   o\tOn Unix, protect against broken pipes where popen calls succeed\n\teven though the command does not exist (and the glibc manual\n\tsays it should return NULL).  (PR#1959)\n\n   o\tdata.frame() was allowing explicit row.names with missing\n\tvalues, but row names are required to be unique.\n\n   o\tas.character(expression) was silently truncating to 60\n\tcharacters: the help page claimed 500 which is now true.\n\n   o\tas.hclust(x) now also works (as identity) for &quot;hclust&quot; objects.\n\n   o\tNextMethod didn't work right in Ops.\n\n   o\tdotchart() now obeys `xlim ='.\n\n   o\tt(x) behaves when x is a (multivariate) time series. (PR#1998)\n\n   o\tparse(text=x) no longer parses from stdin if length(x) is zero\n\n   o\tbinom.test() miscalculated p-value in some extreme cases\n\n   o\tget(&quot;print.ts&quot;)(1) would segfault. It's now just an error.\n\n   o\tcbind(NULL) {and similar} gave an error instead of NULL.\n\n   o\tthe complex version of solve(a,b) now also works if b is a\n        vector\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a patch upgrade,\nfixing the most important bugs that cropped up after the 1.5.0 release.\n\nA set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.5.1 has\nbeen bundled up. Binary distributions should include these packages.\n\nYou can get the files from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for\nvarious platforms will appear in due course.\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies and a patch file against 1.5.0.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n NOTE: I discovered late in the release process that there is still a\n small problem with the 8.0.x tcl/tk compatibility. A fix is\n forthcoming.\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tEnhancements to mathematical annotation of plots:\n\n\t- expressions involving dot(&lt;something&gt;) now produce a dot accent\n\t  above the &lt;something&gt; (initial patch from Ben Bolker).\n\n\t- within an expression, the symbol partialdiff is now converted\n\t  to a partial differential symbol (greek delta).\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline() has a new argument `nknots' allowing to set the\n\tdefault number of knots (when `all.knots = FALSE' as per default).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tRdconv now skips CRs in input files, even on Unix.\n\n    o\treadBin() had a (very slow) memory leak if changing size or reading\n\tcharacter strings.  writeChar() had a memory leak.\n\n    o\tpolygon() and rect() with lty = &quot;blank&quot; were omitting the fill\n\tcolour (if present).  symbols(circles=, lty=&quot;blank&quot;) was\n\tdrawing the border of the disks.\n\n    o\tSubsetting non-existent rows in a data frame would produce\n\tmissing row names, which are not allowed.\n\n    o\tOn Unix, R_PAPERSIZE was set to '' instead of 'a4' as default on\n\tsystems without paperconf.\n\n    o\tUnder GNOME, capabilities() now reports correctly that X11, png\n\tand jpeg are available (if they are under X11).\n\n    o\tThe names of some results of unlist() had the wrong internal\n\tlength, which confused paste().\t Both have been corrected. (PR#1524)\n\n    o\tRweaveLatex.Rd had unbalanced braces in section &quot;Supported\n\tOptions&quot;.\n\n    o\tmerge() with multiple and differently-named match columns\n\tfailed. (PR#1510)\n\n    o\tNAs in right-justified unquoted character matrices were being\n\tmis-aligned.  This mainly affected printing data frames.\n\n    o\tpredict.*bSpline() bugs extrapolating for deriv &gt;= 1 (PR#1473),\n\tand predict.[bn]s bug e.g. for bs(x), reported by Ch.Sangiorgio.\n\n    o\tqr.X was failing if n &lt; p.  Fixed, but only in the case when\n\tpivoting does not occur. (PR#1519)\n\n    o\txx[, 1:3] was returning a list if xx had only one row, even\n\tthough xx[1, 1:3] was a data frame. (PR#1530)\n\n    o\tnls() was reporting incorrectly the number of iterations if the\n\tmaximum was reached.\n\n    o\trbind.data.frame() was coercing logical columns to factors.\n\t(PR#1536)\n\n    o\tRprof(NULL) or Rprof(&quot;&quot;) called when not profiling caused a\n\tsegfault: now silently ignored.\t (PR#1471)\n\n    o\tOn systems (e.g. Windows) using R's own code for expm1, the\n\tvalues were wrong for large negative x, and this affected\n\tpweibull(), for example.\n\n    o\tprettyNum(*, bigmark=*) added extra marks in some cases. (PR#1548)\n\n    o\tcut.dendrogram() failed in some cases. (PR#1552)\n\n    o\tThe links in refman.pdf were broken by a single invalid\n\t\\alias{}. Now Rdconv checks more comprehensively. (PR#1550)\n\n    o\tpredict(smooth.spline(x,*), deriv =1) did not predict at all `x'\n\tvalues, and\n\tsmooth.spline(x,*, all.knots = TRUE) used much too much memory\n\twhen length(x) was largish.\n\tsmooth.spline(*, .... trace = TRUE ..) is a bit more self-explaining.\n\n    o\tpexp(x, log=TRUE) and pweibull(*) were losing precision for large x.\n\n    o\tWorkaround for NetBSD bug in compiling dounzip.c. (PR#1565/6)\n\n    o\tConversions to numeric in type.convert were always treating &quot;NA&quot; as\n\tmissing whatever the setting of na.strings. (PR#1568)\n\n    o\tR CMD check now deals correctly with package names containing a\n\t'.' in the Depends field of a DESCRIPTION file. (PR#1591)\n\n    o\tpbinom() and pbinom() were misssing the &quot;fuzz&quot; that other discrete\n\tdistributions have in order to guard against truncation.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;=&quot; assignment operator behaved as &quot;&lt;&lt;-&quot; in some constructions\n\twith composite left-hand sides.\n\n    o\tAdded print.AsIs() method to ensure &quot;AsIs&quot; objects are printed\n\tby the method for their real class. (PR#1587)\n\n    o\tmosaicplot(*, color = v) now recycles v[] if needed.\n\n    o\tCalling dev.control(&quot;inhibit&quot;) with no graphics device open\n\tcrashed R. (PR#1605)\n\n    o\tread.dcf() was not checking that memory allocation succeeded.\n\n    o\tThe C function fprec might overflow for &gt; 16 digits, showing\n\tup in example(str) on some platforms.\n\n    o\tChanges to the methods package:\n\n\t- Nonstandard generic function definitions given to\n\t  setGeneric now work; these were previously ignored.\n\n\t- Classes that extend matrix, etc. as the data part previously lost\n\t  their attributes.\n\n\t- There were bugs in distinguishing methods for &quot;missing&quot; from\n\t  methods for &quot;ANY&quot;.\n\n\t- Some coerce methods were not selected correctly when the two classes\n\t  were related by an &quot;is&quot; relation.\n\n\t- extends() now works correctly if given a class definition rather\n\t  than a name.\n\n\t- class()&lt;- was leaving in an explicit class attribute for basic data\n\t  types.\n\n\t- Method signatures including arguments following &quot;...&quot; in the\n\t  argument list of the generic didn't work.\n\n    o\tpar(mgp = v) now allows negative `v' (S-compatibly and sensibly).\n\n    o\tidentify.hclust() masked its `x' argument and so failed.\n\n    o\tSystem rint was never being used in fround.c.\n\n    o\tround/trunc.POSIXt were erroneously retaining information on\n\tDST. (PR#1543)\n\n    o\ttcltk package didn't work with tcl8.0.x.  Compatibility code\n\tinserted (PR#1640, thanks to Ren&#233; Bertin for helping out with\n\tthis).\n\n    o\tselfStart() {pkg &quot;nls&quot;} now works again when parameter names are\n\tnot specified (but implicit).\n\n    o\tlegend() now treats lty=&quot;0&quot; properly (as solid).\n\n    o\tARMAacf was failing if 0 &lt; p &lt; q+1: it failed to say that ar needed\n\tto be padded with zeroes, and now the code does that.\n\n    o\told.packages() was assuming a bundle was installed in only one\n\tlibrary, and so update.packages() would only update a bundle\n\tin the first location in lib.loc.\n\n    o\tfisher.test() could miscalculate odds ratio and confidence\n\tinterval for tables with large entries, due to numerical\n\toverflow.\n\n    o\tUsing lty = &quot;1&quot; (or &quot;10&quot;) does no longer produce invalid\n\tpostscript or pdf.  Using &quot;0&quot; in a character lty is currently not\n\timplemented device-independently and needs more fixing.\n\n    o\tccf(plot = FALSE) was returning a spurious extra 0 at lag 0.\n\n    o\tOn console-based versions of R (Windows, GNOME, probably\n\tMacOS) warning/error messages longer than 8192 chars could\n\tcrash R. (PR#1651)\n\n    o\tComparisons between objects of mode &quot;call&quot; using &quot;==&quot; now return\n\tTRUE if both sides deparse to the same string (as always intended).\n\n    o\tHoltWinters() now initializes correctly in the exponential\n\tsmoothing case, and plot.HoltWinters() allows lty to be set.\n\n    o\tfisher.test() crashed due to corruption on some large\n\tproblems.  It also crashed on tables with total one. (PR#1662)\n\n    o\tThe substitution code for strptime (used e.g. on Windows)\n\tcached the month names and so did not recognise locale changes\n\tduring an R session, as used by get.hist.quote{tseries}.\n\tCaching has been supressed.  (PR#1116)\n\n    o\tSome functions used the non-existing error() function instead\n\tof stop().\n\n    o\tvector(&quot;complex&quot;,n)  doesn't return random garbage anymore.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a major upgrade,\nwith several new features. \n\nA few of the changes generate compatibility issues. You may wish to\nconsult <A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org/150update.txt.\">http://developer.r-project.org/150update.txt.</A>\n\nA set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.5.0 has\nbeen bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these\npackages.\n\nYou can get the files from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. Binaries for\nvarious platforms will appear in due course.\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.0\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    o\tXDR support is now guaranteed to be available, so the default\n\tsave format will always be XDR binary files, and it is safe to\n\tdistribute data in that format.  (We are unaware of any\n\tplatform that did not support XDR in recent versions of R.)\n\n\tgzfile() is guaranteed to be available, so the preferred\n\tmethod to distribute sizeable data objects is now via\n\tsave(compress = TRUE).\n\n    o\tpie() replaces piechart() and defaults to using pastel colours.\n\n    o\tformatC has new arguments (see below) and formatC(*, d = &lt;dig&gt;)\n\tis no longer valid and must be written as formatC(*, digits = &lt;dig&gt;).\n\n    o\tMissingness of character strings is treated much more\n\tconsistently, and the character string &quot;NA&quot; can be used as a\n\tnon-missing value.\n\n    o   summary.factor() now uses a stable sort, so the output will\n\tchange where there are ties in the frequencies.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   Changes in handing missing character strings:\n\n        -  &quot;NA&quot; is no longer automatically coerced to a missing value\n\t   for a character string.  Use as.character(NA) where a missing\n\t   value is required, and test via is.na(x) not x == &quot;NA&quot;.\n\t   String &quot;NA&quot; is still converted to missing by scan() and\n\t   read.table() unless `na.strings' is changed from the default.\n\n        -  A missing character string is now printed as `NA' (no quotes)\n\t   amongst quoted character strings, and `&lt;NA&gt;' if amongst\n\t   unquoted character strings.\n\n        -  axis() and text.default() omit missing values of their\n\t   `labels' argument (rather than plotting &quot;NA&quot;).\n\n        -  Missing character strings are treated as missing much more\n\t   consistently, e.g. in logical comparisons and in sorts.\n\t   identical() now differentiates &quot;NA&quot; from the missing string.\n\n\n    o   Changes in package methods:\n\n\t-  New function validSlotNames().\n\n\t-  Classes can explicitly have a &quot;data part&quot;, formally\n\t   represented as a .Data slot in the class definition, but\n\t   implemented consistently with informal structures.  While the\n\t   implementation is different, the user-level behavior largely\n\t   follows the discussion in &quot;Programming with Data&quot;.\n\n       -   A &quot;next method&quot; facility has been provided, via the function\n\t   callNextMethod().  This calls the method that would have been\n\t   selected if the currently active method didn't exist.  See\n\t   ?callNextMethod().  This is an extension to the API.\n\n       -   Classes can have initialize methods, which will be called\n\t   when the function new() is used to create an object from the\n\t   class.  See ?initialize.  This is an extension to the API.\n\n       -   The logic of setGeneric() has been clarified, simplifying\n\t   nonstandard generic functions and default methods.\n\n\n    o\tChanges in package tcltk:\n\n        -  Now works with the GNOME user interface.\n\n        -  Several new functions allow access to C level Tcl objects. \n\t   These are implemented using a new `tclObj' class, and this\n\t   is now the class of the return value from .Tcl() and tkcmd().\n\n\n    o\tChanges in package ts:\n\n\t-  More emphasis on handling time series with missing values\n\t   where possible, for example in acf() and in the\n\t   ARIMA-fitting functions.\n\n\t-  New function arima() which will replace arima0() in due\n           course.  Meanwhile, arima0() has been enhanced in several\n           ways.  Missing values are accepted.  Parameter values can\n           be initialized and can held fixed during fitting.  There is\n           a new argument `method' giving the option to use\n           conditional-sum-of-squares estimation.\n\n\t-  New function arima.sim().\n\n\t-  New datasets AirPassengers, Nile, UKgas and WWWusage,\n\t   and a expanded version of UKDriverDeaths (as a multiple\n\t   time series Seatbelts).\n\n\t-  New generic function tsdiag() and methods for arima and arima0,\n\t   to produce diagnostic plots.  Supersedes arima0.diag().\n\n\t-  New functions ARMAacf() and ARMAtoMA() to compute\n           theoretical quantities for an ARMA process.\n\n\t-  New function acf2AR() to compute the AR process with a given\n           autocorrelation function.\n\n\t-  New function StructTS() to fit structural time series, and\n\t   new generic function tsSmooth() for fixed-interval\n\t   state-space smoothing of such models.\n\n\t-  New function monthplot() (contributed by Duncan Murdoch).\n\n\t-  New functions decompose() and HoltWinters() (contributed by \n\t   David Meyer) for classical seasonal decomposition and\n\t   exponentially-weighted forecasting.\n\n\n    o\tAn extensible approach to safe prediction for models with e.g.\n\tpoly(), bs() or ns() terms, using the new generic function\n\tmakepredictcall().  Used by most model-fitting functions\n\tincluding lm() and glm().  See ?poly, ?cars and ?ns for\n\texamples.\n\n    o   acosh(), asinh(), atanh() are guaranteed to be available.\n\n    o   axis() now omits labels which are NA (but still draws the\n\ttick mark.\n\n    o\tConnections to bzip2-ed files via bzfile().\n\n    o   chol() allows pivoting via new argument `pivot'.\n\n    o\tcmdscale() now takes rownames from a dist object `d' as well\n\tas from a matrix; it has new arguments `add' (as S) and `x.ret'.\n\n    o   crossprod() handles the case of real matrices with y = x\n\tseparately (by accepting y = NULL).  This gives a small\n\tperformance gain (suggestion of Jonathan Rougier).\n\n    o   deriv/deriv3() can now handle expressions involving pnorm and\n\tdnorm (with a single argument), as in S-PLUS.\n\n    o\tNew function expm1() both in R and in C API, for accurate exp(x)-1;\n\tprecision improvement in pexp() and pweibull() in some cases.\n\t(PR#1334-5)\n\n    o\tNew function findInterval() {using new C entry point\n\tfindInterval, see below}.\n\n    o\tformatDL() now also works if both items and descriptions are\n\tgiven in a suitable list or matrix.\n\n    o\tgzfile() is guaranteed to be available, and hence the\n\t`compress' option to save() and save.image().\n\n    o\thist() now has a method for date-time objects.\n\n    o\tlibrary() now checks the dependence on R version (if any) and\n\twarns if the package was built under a later version of R.\n\n    o\tlibrary(help = PKG) now also returns the information about the\n\tpackage PKG.\n\n    o\tAdded function logb(), same as log() but for S-PLUS\n\tcompatibility (where log now has only one argument).\n\n    o   New na.action function na.pass() passes through NAs unaltered.\n\n    o   piechart() has been renamed to pie(), as piechart is a Trellis\n\tfunction for arrays of pie charts.  The default fill colours\n\tare now a set of pastel shades, rather than par(&quot;bg&quot;).\n\n    o\tplclust() in package mva, for more S-PLUS compatibility.\n\n    o\tpoly() now works with more than one vector or a matrix as input,\n\tand has a predict method for objects created from a single\n\tvector.\n\n    o\tpolyroot() now handles coefficient vectors with terminal\n\tzeroes (as in S).\n\n    o\tNew prettyNum() function used in formatC() and format.default()\n        which have new optional arguments `big.mark', `big.interval',\n        `small.mark', `small.interval', and `decimal.mark'.\n\n    o\tprint.coefmat() has a new argument 'eps.Pvalue' for determining\n        when small P-values should be printed as  &quot;&lt; {...}&quot;.\n\n    o   The recover() function has been moved to the base package.\n        This is an interactive debugging function, usually a good\n        choice for options(error=).  See ?recover.\n\n    o\trep() has a new argument `each' for S-PLUS compatibility.\n\tThe internal call is made available as rep.int(), again for\n\thelp in porting code.\n\n    o\tNew functions rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans() and colMeans():\n\tversions of apply() optimized for these cases.\n\n    o\trug() now has a &quot;...&quot; argument allowing its location to be specified.\n\n    o\tscan() can have NULL elements in `what', useful to save space\n\twhen columns need to be discarded.\n\n    o\tNew option by = &quot;DSTday&quot; for seq.POSIXt().\n\n    o   Changes to sorting:\n\n\t-  sort(), sort.list() and order() have a new argument\n\t   `decreasing' to allow the order to be reversed whilst\n\t   still preserving ties.\n\n\t-  sort() has an option to use quicksort in some cases\n\t   (currently numeric vectors and increasing order).\n\n\t-  The default Shell sort is Sedgewick's variant, around 20%\n           faster, and pre-screening for NAs speeds cases without any\n\t   NAs several-fold.\n\n\t-  sort.list() (and order with just one vector) is several\n\t   times faster for numeric, integer and logical vectors, and\n\t   faster for character vectors.\n\n    o   New assignment forms of split(); new function unsplit().\n\n    o\tNew sprintf() function for general C like formatting, from\n\tJonathan Rougier.\n\n    o\tArgument `split' of summary.{aov,aovlist} is now implemented.\n\n    o\tsummary.princomp() now has a separate print() method, and\n\t`digits' is now an argument to the print method and not to\n\tsummary.princomp itself.\n\n    o   An extended version of the trace() function is available,\n        compatible with the function in S-PLUS.  Calls to R functions\n        can be inserted on entry, on exit, and before any\n        subexpressions. Calls to browser() and recover() are useful.\n        See ?trace.\n\n    o   New function TukeyHSD() for multiple comparisons in the results\n\tof aov().  (Formerly function Tukey in package Devore5 by\n\tDouglas Bates.)\n\n    o\tNew read-only connections to files in zip files via unz().\n\n    o\twarning() has new argument `call.', like stop()'s.\n\n    o\tzip.file.extract() is no longer provisional and has an\n\t&quot;internal&quot; method available on all platforms.\n\n    o\tMethods for [, [&lt;- and as.data.frame() for class &quot;POSIXlt&quot;.\n\n    o   Much improved printing of matrices and arrays of type &quot;list&quot;.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;Knuth-TAOCP&quot; option for random-number generation has been\n\tgiven an option of using the 2002 revision.  See ?RNG for the\n\tdetails: the R usage already protected against the\n\treported `weakness'.\n\n    o   min/max of integer(0) (or NULL) is now Inf/-Inf, not an\n\textreme integer.\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\t.Alias, reshapeLong(), reshapeWide() are defunct.\n\n    o\tarima0.diag() (package ts) is deprecated: use tsdiag() instead.\n\n    o\tpiechart() is deprecated; renamed to pie().\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION CHANGES\n\n    o\t`Writing R Extensions' now has an example of calling R's\n\trandom numbers from FORTRAN via C.\n\n    o   R itself and all R manuals now have ISBN numbers, please use\n        them when citing R or one of the manuals.\n\n\nINSTALLATION CHANGES\n\n    o\tThe configure script used when building R from source under Unix\n\tis now generated using Autoconf 2.50 or later, which has the\n\tfollowing 'visible' consequences:\n\n\t- By default, configure no longer uses a cache file.  Use the\n          command line option '--config-cache' (or '-C') to enable\n          caching.\n\n\t- Key configuration variables such as 'CC' are now *precious*,\n          implying that the variables\n\n\t  * no longer need to be exported to the environment and can and\n            should be set as command line arguments;\n\n\t  * are kept in the cache even if not specified on the command\n            line, and checked for consistency between two configure runs\n            (provided that caching is used, see above);\n\n\t  * are kept during automatic reconfiguration as if having been\n            passed as command line arguments, even if no cache is used.\n\n\t  See the variable output section of 'configure --help' for a\n\t  list of all these variables.\n\n    o   Configure variable 'FC' is deprecated, and options '--with-g77',\n\t'--with-f77' and '--with-f2c' are defunct.  Use configure\n\tvariable 'F77' to specify the FORTRAN 77 compiler, and 'F2C' to\n\tspecify the FORTRAN-to-C compiler and/or that it should be used\n\teven if a FORTRAN 77 compiler is available.\n\n    o\tNon-standard directories containing libraries are specified\n\tusing configure variable 'LDFLAGS' (not 'LIBS').\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tSweave(), Stangle() and friends in package tools.  Sweave allows\n\tmixing LaTeX documentation and R code in a single source file:\n\tthe R code can be replaced by its output (text, figures) to\n\tallow automatic report generation.  Sweave files found in\n\tpackage subdir 'inst/doc' are automatically tested by R CMD\n\tcheck and converted to PDF by R CMD build, see the section on\n\tpackage vignettes in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.\n\n    o\tRdconv can convert to the S4 '.sgml' format.\n\n    o   R::Utils.pm masks some platform dependencies in perl code by\n        providing global variables like R_OSTYPE or wrapper functions\n        like R_runR().\n\n    o   If a directory 'inst/doc' is present in the sources of a\n        package, the HTML index of the installed package has a link to\n        the respective subdirectory.\n\n    o\tR CMD check is more stringent: it now also fails on malformed\n\t'Depends' and 'Maintainer' fields in 'DESCRIPTION' files, and on\n\tunbalanced braces in Rd files.  It now also provides pointers to\n\tdocumentation for problems it reports.\n\n    o\tR CMD check, build and INSTALL produce outline-type output.\n\n    o\tQA functions in package 'tools' now return the results of their\n\tcomputations as objects with suitable print() methods.  By\n\tdefault, output\tis only produced if a problem was found.\n\n    o\tNew utility R CMD config to get the values of basic R configure\n\tvariables, or the header and library flags necessary for linking\n\tagainst R.\n\n    o   Rdindex and maketitle.pl require perl 5.005, as Text::Wrap::fill\n\twas only introduced at 5.004_05.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tAll the double-precision BLAS routines are now available,\n\tand package writers are encouraged not to include their own\n\t(so enhanced ones will be used if requested at configuration).\n\n    o\tfindInterval(xt[],n,x,...) gives the index (or interval number)\n\tof x in the sorted sequence xt[].  There's an\n\tF77_SUB(interv)(.) to be called from Fortran; this used to be\n\tpart of predict.smooth.spline's underlying Fortran code.\n\n    o\tSubstitutes for (v)snprintf will be used if the OS does not\n\tsupply one, so tests for HAVE_(V)SNPRINTF are no longer needed.\n\n    o\tThe DUP and NAOK arguments in a .C() call are not passed on\n\tto the native routine being invoked.  Any code that relied on\n\tthe old behaviour will need to be modified.\n\n    o\tlog1p is only provided in Rmath.h if it is not provided by the\n\tplatform, in which case its name is not remapped, but a\n\tback-compatibility entry point Rf_log1p is provided.\n\tApplications using libRmath may need to be re-compiled.\n\n    o\tThe methods used by optim() and integrate() have entry points in\n\tR_ext/Applic.h and have a more general interface documented in\n\t`Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tThe bessel_? entry points are now suitable to be called\n\trepeatedly from code loaded by .C().  (They did not free\n\tmemory until .C() returned in earlier versions of R.)\n\n    o\tServer sockets on non-Windows platforms now set the SO_REUSEADDR\n\tsocket option.  This allows a server to create simultanous\n\tconnections to several clients.\n\n    o\tNew quicksort sorting (for numeric no-NA data), accessible from\n        C as R_qsort() etc and from Fortran as qsort4() and qsort3().\n\n    o\tRinternals.h no longer includes fcntl.h, as this is not an\n\tISO C header and cannot be guaranteed to exist.\n\n    o\tFortran subroutines are more correctly declared as `extern void'\n\tin R_exts/Applic.h and R_exts/Linpack.h.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tThe calculation of which axes to label on a persp() plot was\n\tincorrect in some cases.\n\n    o\tInsufficient information was being recorded in the display list\n\tfor the identify() function.  In particular, the &quot;plot=&quot;\n\targument was ignored when replaying the display list. (PR#1157)\n\n    o\tThe vertical alignment of mathematical annotations was wrong.\n\tWhen a vertical adjustment was not given, it was bottom-adjusting\n\ti.e,. it was treating adj=0 as adj=c(0, 0).  It now treats\n\tadj=0 as adj=c(0, 0.5) as for &quot;normal&quot; text. (PR#1302)\n\n    o\tthe man page (doc/R.1) wasn't updated with the proper VERSION.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline() had a &quot;df = 5&quot; default which was never used and\n\thence extraneous and misleading.\n\n    o\tread.fwf() was interpreting comment chars in its call to scan:\n\treplaced by a call to readlines(). (PR#1297/8)\n\n    o\tThe default has been changed to scan(comment.char=&quot;&quot;) for\n\tconsistency with earlier code (as in the previous item).\n\n    o\tbxp(*, notch.frac = f) now draws the median line correctly.\n\n    o\tCurrent versions of gs were rotating the output of\n\tbitmap(type = &quot;pdfwrite&quot;) and when converting the output\n\tof postscript() to PDF; this has been circumvented by\n\tsuppressing the %%Orientation comment for non-standard\n\tpaper sizes.\n\n    o\tplot.ts(x, log = &quot;y&quot;) works again when x has 0s, also for matrix x.\n\n    o\tadd1(), drop1(), step() work again on glm objects with\n\tformulae with rhs's containing `.'.  (Broken by a `bug fix'\n\t(in reality an API change) in 1.2.1.)\n\n    o\toptim(method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) was not reporting reaching `maxit'\n\titerations in the convergence component of the return value.\n\n    o\taov() and model.tables() were failing on multistrata models with\n\texcessively long Error formula. (PR#1315)\n\n    o\tTransparent backgrounds on png() devices on Unix-alikes had\n\tbeen broken during the driver changes just prior to 1.4.0.\n\t(They worked correctly on Windows.)\n\n    o\tdemo(is.things) didn't work properly when the methods package was\n\tattached.\n\n    o\tmatch(), unique() and duplicated() were not declaring all NaNs to be\n\tequal, yet not always distinguishing NA and NaN.  This was\n\tvery rare except for data imported as binary numbers.\n\n    o   The error handler recover() protects itself against errors in\n        dump.frames and uses a new utility, limitedLabels, to generate\n        names for the dump that don't inadvertently blow the limit on\n        symbol length.  (TODO:  either fix dump.frames accordingly or\n        remove the limit--say by truncating very long symbols?)\n\n    o\tse.contrasts() works more reliably with multistratum models,\n\tand its help page has an example.\n\n    o\tsummary.lm() was not returning r.squared nor adj.r.squared for\n\tintercept-only models, but summary.lm.null() was returning\n\tr.squared but not adj.r.squared.  Now both are always\n\treturned.  Neither returned f.statistic, and that is now\n\tdocumented.\n\n    o\tSubsetting of matrices of mode list (or other non-atomic\n\tmodes) was not implemented and gave incorrect results without\n\twarning. (PR#1329)\n\tUnder some circumstances subsetting of a character matrix\n\tinserted NA in the wrong place.\n\n    o   abs() was not being treated as member of the Math group\n\tgeneric function, so e.g. its method for data frames was not\n\tbeing used.\n\n    o\tset.seed(seed, &quot;default&quot;) was not using the `seed' value (only\n\tfor kind = &quot;default&quot;).\n\n    o\tlogLik.lm() now uses  &quot;df = p + 1&quot; again (`+ sigma'!).\n\n    o\tlogLik.glm() was incorrect for families with estimated dispersion.\n\n    o\tAdded strptime() workaround for those platforms (such as\n\tSolaris) that returned missing components as 0.  Missing\n\tdays are now detected, but missing years will still\n\tbe interpreted as 1900 on such platforms.\n\n    o   Inheritance in formal classes (the methods package) works\n        breadth-first as intuition would expect.\n\n    o\tThe new() function in package `methods' works better (maybe even\n        correctly?) for the various combinations of super-classes and\n        prototypes that can be supplied as unnamed arguments.\n\n    o\tInternal code allowed one more connection to be allocated than\n\tthe table size, leading to segfaults. (PR#1333)\n\n    o\tIf a user asks to open a connection when it is created and\n\tit cannot be opened, the connection is destroyed before returning\n\tfrom the creation call.  (related to PR#1333)\n\n    o\tSys.putenv() was not using permanent storage. (PR#1371)\n\n    o\tLa.svd() was not coercing integer matrices. (PR#1363)\n\n    o\tderiv(3) now reports correctly the function it cannot find\n\tthe derivatives table.\n\n    o   The GNOME user interface was over-enthusiastic about setting\n        locale information.  Now only LC_CTYPE, LC_COLLATE and LC_TIME\n        are determined by the user's environment variables (PR#1321)\n\n    o   In X11, locator() would sound the bell even if &quot;xset b off&quot;\n        had been set.\n\n    o\tmerge() could be confused by inconsistent use of as.character()\n\tgiving leading spaces.\n\n    o   [pqr]binom() no longer silently round the `size' argument,\n\tbut return NaN (as dbinom() does). (PR#1377)\n\n    o\tFixed socket writing code to block until all data is written.\n\tFixed socket reading code to properly handle long reads and reads\n\twith part of the data in the connection buffer.\n\n    o\tAllow sockets to be opened in binary mode with both open=&quot;ab&quot; and\n\topen=&quot;a+b&quot;.\n\n    o\tlevels&lt;-.factor() was using incorrectly list values longer than\n\tthe number of levels (PR#1394), and incorrectly documented\n\tthat a character value could not be longer than the existing\n\tlevels.\n\n    o   The pdf() device was running out of objects before the\n\tdocumented 500 page limit.  Now there is no limit.\n\n    o   legend() did not deal correctly with `angle' arguments. (PR#1404)\n\n    o   sum() tried to give an integer result for integer arguments,\n\tbut (PR#1408)\n\t- this was not documented\n\t- it sometimes warned on overflow, sometimes not\n\t- it was order-dependent for a mixture of integer and numeric args.\n\n    o\tmean() gave (numeric) NA if integer overflow occurred in sum(),\n\tbut now always works internally with numeric (or complex) numbers.\n\n    o\tsort.list() and order() were treating NA_STRING as &quot;NA&quot;.\n\n    o\tsort.list(na.last = NA) was not implemented.\n\n    o\tseq.default() was returning only one element for a relative\n\trange of less than about 1e-8, which was excessively conservative.\n\t(PR#1416)\n\n    o\ttsp(x) &lt;- NULL  now also works after library(methods).\n\n    o\tpersp(shade=) was not working correctly with the default\n\tcol=NULL if this was transparent. (PR#1419)\n\n    o\tmin/max(complex(0)) was returning a random value.\n\n    o   range() gave c(1, 1).\n\n    o\trange(numeric(0)) is now c(Inf, -Inf), as it was documented to be.\n\n    o   print.ts() was occasionally making rounding errors in the labels\n\tfor multiple calendar time series.\n\n    o   Rdconv was not handling nested \\describe{} constructs when\n\tconverting to HTML (PR#1257) and not fixing up mal-formed\n\t\\item fields in \\describe{} when converting to text (PR#1330).\n\n    o   filled.contour() was not checking consistency of x, y, z.\n\t(PR#1432)\n\n    o   persp.default() no longer crashes with non-character labels.\n\t(PR#1431)\n\n    o   fft() gave incorrect answers for input sizes 392, 588, 968, 980 ....\n\t(PR#1429)\n\n    o   det(method = &quot;qr&quot;) gave incorrect results for numerically\n\tsingular matrices. (PR#1244)\n\n    o   barplot() now allows the user to control `xpd'. (PR#1088, 1398)\n\n    o   library() (with no arguments) no longer fails on empty TITLE files.\n\n    o   glm() was failing if both offset() and start were specified. (PR#1421)\n\n    o\tglm() might have gotten confused if both step-shortening and\n\tpivoting had occurred (PR#1331).  Step-halving to avoid the\n\tboundary of feasible values was not working.\n\n    o   Internal representation of logical values was not being\n\ttreated consistently. (Related to PR#1439)\n\n    o   The c() function sometimes inserted garbage in the name vector\n        for some types of objects, e.g.  names(c(ls, a=1)).\n\n    o   Fixed bug in `$' that could cause mutations on assignment (PR#1450).\n\n    o   Some X servers displayed random bytes in the window title of\n\tgraphics windows (PR#1451)\n\n    o   The X11 data editor would segfault if closed with window manager\n        controls (PR#1453)\n\n    o\tInterrupt of Sys.sleep() on UNIX no longer causes subsequent\n\tSys.sleep() calls to segfault due to infinite recusion.\n\n    o   Eliminated a race condition that could cause segfaults when a SIGINT\n\twas received while handling an earlier SIGINT.\n\n    o   rect(lty = &quot;blank&quot;) was incorrectly drawing with a dashed line.\n\n    o   type.convert() was not reporting incorrectly formatting complex \n\tinputs. (PR#1477)\n\n    o   readChar() was not resetting vmax, so causing memory build-up.\n\t(PR#1483)\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a patch upgrade,\nfixing the most important bugs that cropped up after the 1.4.0 release.\n\nA set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.4.1 has\nbeen bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these\npackages.\n\nYou can get the files from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz\">http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.4.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This may not\nhappen right away due to circumstances in Vienna. Binaries for various\nplatforms will appear in due course.\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies and a patch file against 1.4.0.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.1\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tscan(multi.line = FALSE) now always gives an immediate error\n\tmessage if a line is incomplete. (As requested in PR#1210)\n\n    o\tread.table() is no longer very slow in processing comments:\n\tmoved to C code and fewer lines checked.\n\n    o\ttype.convert() could give stack imbalance warnings if used\n\twith as.is = TRUE.\n\n    o\tpredict.mlm ignored newdata (PR#1226) and also offsets.\n\n    o\tdemo(tkttest) was inadvertently changed in 1.4.0 so that it would\n\tevaluate the requested test, but not display the result.\n\n    o\tstars(scale = TRUE) (the default) now works as documented (and\n\tas S does).  Previously it only scaled the maximum to 1. (PR#1230)\n\n    o\td0 &lt;- data.frame(a = 0); data.matrix(d0[0, 0]) and\n\tdata.matrix(d0[, 0]) now work.\n\n    o\tplot(multiple time series, plot.type = &quot;single&quot;) was computing\n\t`ylim' from the first series only.\n\n    o\tplot.acf() has a new `xpd = par(&quot;xpd&quot;)' argument which by default\n\t*does* clipping (of the horizontal lines) as desired (xpd = NA was\n\tused before, erronously in most cases).\n\n    o\tpredict(smooth.spline(.), deriv = 1) now works.\n\n    o\tidentify() failed when x is a structure/matrix. (PR#1238)\n\n    o\tgetMethod() returns NULL when optional=TRUE as promised in the\n\tdocumentation.\n\n    o\tsetMethod() allows &quot;...&quot; to be one of the arguments omitted in\n\tthe method definition (but so far no check for ... being missing)\n\n    o\tAllow round() to work again on very large numbers (introduced\n\tin fixing PR#1138). (PR#1254)\n\n    o\tRinternals.h is now accepted by a C++ compiler.\n\n    o\ttype.convert() was failing to detect integer overflow.\n\n    o\tpiechart() was defaulting to foreground colour (black) fills\n\trather than background (as used in 1.3.1 and earlier).\tNow\n\tbackground is used, but be aware that as from 1.4.0 this may\n\tbe transparent.\n\n    o\tLa.eigen(*, only.values=TRUE) does not segfault anymore in one\n\tbranch (PR#1262).\n\n    o\tcut() now produces correct default labels even when\n\tinclude.lowest = TRUE (PR#1263).\n\n    o\treformulate() works properly with a response.\n\n    o\tcmdscale(*, k = 1) now works properly.\n\n    o\tOptions by = &quot;month&quot; and &quot;year&quot; to seq.POSIXt() will always\n\ttake account of changes to/from daylight savings time: this\n\twas not working on some platforms.\n\n    o\tglm.fit.null() now accepts all the arguments of glm.fit() (it\n\tcould be called from glm.fit with arguments it did not\n\taccept), and is now documented.\n\n    o\tcov.wt(cbind(1), cor = TRUE) now works.\n\n    o\tpredict(glm.object, se.fit = TRUE) was failing if the fit\n\tinvolved an offset.\n\n    o\tdetach() on package:base would crash R. (PR#1271)\n\n    o\tprint or summary on a manova() object with no terms, no names on\n\tthe response and intercept = FALSE (which is not sensible)\n\twould give an error.\n\n    o\tseek() on file connections was ignoring the `origin' argument.\n\n    o\tFixed new environment handling in library() to avoid forcing\n\tpromises created by delay()\n\n    o\tarima0() could leak memory: now released via on.exit().\n\n    o\tqr.coef(qr,*) now keeps the names of qr$qr.\n\n    o\tread.00Index() no longer fails on data indexes not generated by\n\tRdindex (PR#1274).\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

Binary distributions are expected to include these\npackages.\n\nYou can get the files from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.4.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This may not\nhappen right away due to circumstances in Vienna. Binaries for various\nplatforms will appear in due course.\n\nAs usual, we try to ensure that R can be built on as many platforms as\npossible. However, this time the problem with Fortran dynamic\nlibraries on RedHat 6.2, which previously only affected some packages,\nhas caught up with the main distribution. I.e. you cannot build R on\nthat platform without upgrading the compiler suite (building with f2c\nprobably works).\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.0\n\n\nUSER-VISIBLE CHANGES\n\n    [This is a new section to highlight changes in behaviour, which\n    may be given in more detail in the following sections.\n    Many bug fixes are also user-visible changes.]\n\n    o\tThe default save format has been changed, so saved workspaces\n\tand objects cannot (by default) be read in earlier versions of R.\n\n    o\tThe number of bins selected by default in a histogram uses\n\tthe correct version of Sturges' formula and will usually be\n\tone larger.\n\n    o\tdata.frame() no longer converts logical arguments to factors\n\t(following S4 rather than S3).\n\n    o\tread.table() has new arguments `nrows' and `colClasses'.  If the\n\tlatter is NA (the default), conversion is attempted to\n\tlogical, integer, numeric or complex, not just to numeric.\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix() treats logical variables as a factors with\n\tlevels c(FALSE, TRUE) (rather than 0-1 valued numerical\n\tvariables).  This makes R compatible with all S versions.\n\n    o\tTransparency is now supported on most graphics devices.\n\tThis means that using par(&quot;bg&quot;), for example in legend(), will\n\tby default give a transparent rather than opaque background.\n\n    o\t[dpqr]gamma now has third argument `rate' for S-compatibility\n\t(and for compatibility with exponentials).  Calls which use\n\tpositional matching may need to be altered.\n\n    o\tThe meaning of spar = 0 in smooth.spline() has changed.\n\n    o\tsubstring() and substring()&lt;- do nothing silently on a\n\tcharacter vector of length 0, rather than generating an\n\terror.\tThis is consistent with other functions and with S.\n\n    o\tFor compatibility with S4, any arithmetic operation using a\n\tzero-length vector has a zero-length result.  (This was\n\talready true for logical operations, which were compatible\n\twith S4 rather than S3.)\n\n    o\tundoc() and codoc() have been moved to the new package `tools'.\n\n    o\tThe name of the site profile now defaults to\n\t`R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site'.\n\n    o\tThe startup process for setting environment variables now first\n\tsearches for a site environment file (given by the environment\n\tvariable `R_ENVIRON' if set or `R_HOME/etc/Renviron.site' if\n\tnot), *and* then for a user `.Renviron' file in the current or\n\tthe user's home directory.\n\n    o\tFormer stars(*, colors = v) must now be stars(*, col.segments = v).\n\n    o\tThe default methods for La.svd and La.eigen have changed and\n\tso there may be sign changes in singular/eigen vectors,\n\tincluding in cancor, cmdscale, factanal, princomp and varimax.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tTransparency is now supported on most graphics devices.\n\tInternally colors include an alpha channel for opacity, but at\n\tpresent there is only visible support for transparent/opaque.\n\tThe new color &quot;transparent&quot; (or NA or &quot;NA&quot;) is transparent,\n\tand is the default background color for most devices.  Those\n\tdevices (postscript, XFig, PDF, Windows metafile and printer)\n\tthat previously treated bg = &quot;white&quot; as transparent now have\n\t&quot;transparent&quot; as the default and will actually print &quot;white&quot;.\n\t(NB: you may have bg = &quot;white&quot; saved in .Postscript.options in\n\tyour workspace.)\n\n    o\tA package `methods' has been added, containing formal classes\n\tand methods (&quot;S4&quot; methods), implementing the description in\n\tthe book &quot;Programming with Data&quot;.  See &quot;?Methods&quot; and the\n\treferences there for more information.\n\n\t- In support of this, the &quot;@&quot; operator has been added to the\n\t  grammar.\n\n\t- Method dispatch for formal methods (the standardGeneric\n\t  function), is now a primitive. Aside from efficiency issues,\n\t  this allows S3-style generics to also have formal methods\n\t  (not really recommended in the long run, but it should at\n\t  least work).\tThe C-level dispatch is now implemented for\n\t  primitives that use either DispatchGroup or DispatchOrEval\n\t  internally.\n\n\t- A version of the function &quot;plot&quot; in the methods package has\n\t  arguments &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, to allow methods for either or both.\n\t  See &quot;?setMethod&quot; for examples of such methods.\n\n\t- The methods package now uses C-level code (from within\n\t  DispatchOrEval) to dispatch any methods defined for\n\t  primitive functions.\tAs with S3-style methods, methods can\n\t  only be defined if the first argument satisfies is.object(x)\n\t  (not strictly required for formal methods, but imposed for\n\t  now for simplicity and efficiency).\n\n    o\tChanges to the tcltk package:\n\n\t- New interface for accessing Tcl variables, effectively\n\t  making the R representations lexically scoped. The old form\n\t  is being deprecated.\n\n\t- Callbacks can now be expressions, with slightly unorthodox\n\t  semantics. In particular this allows bindings to contain\n\t  &quot;break&quot; expressions (this is necessary to bind code to\n\t  e.g. Alt-x without having the key combination also insert an\n\t  &quot;x&quot; in a text widget.)\n\n\t- A bunch of file handling and dialog functions (previously\n\t  only available via tkcmd) have been added\n\n    o\tThe &quot;?&quot; operator is now an actual function.  It can be used\n\t(as always) as a unary operator (?plot) and the grammar now\n\tallows it as a binary operator, planned to allow\n\tdifferentiating documentation on the same name but different\n\ttype (class?matrix, for example).  So far, no such\n\tdocumentation exists.\n\n    o\tNew methods AIC.default() and logLik.glm(), also fixing\n\tAIC(&lt;glm obj&gt;).\n\n    o\taxis.POSIXct() allows the label date/times to be specified\n\tvia the new `at' argument.\n\n    o\tarrows() now allows length = 0 (and draws no arrowheads).\n\n    o\tModifications to the access functions for more consistency with S:\n\targuments `name', `pos' and `where' are more flexible in\n\tassign(), exists(), get(), ls(), objects(), remove() and rm().\n\n    o\tThree new primitive functions have been added to base:\n\tdataClass(), objWithClass(), and as.environment().  The first two\n\tare support routines for class() and class&lt;-() in package\n\tmethods.  The third replaces pos.to.env() in the functions get(),\n\texists(), and friends.\n\n    o\tbarplot() now respects an inline `cex.axis' argument and has a\n\tseparate `cex.names' argument so names and the numeric axis\n\tlabels can be scaled separately.  Also, graphics parameters\n\tintended for axis() such as `las' can now be used.\n\n    o\tShading by lines added to functions barplot(), hist(),\n\tlegend(), piechart(), polygon() and rect().\n\n    o\tbxp() has a show.names argument allowing labels on a single\n\tboxplot; it and hence boxplot() now makes use of pch, cex, and bg\n\tfor outlier points().\n\n\tbxp() and boxplot() also have an argument `outline' to suppress\n\toutlier drawing {S-PLUS compatibly}.\n\n    o\tNew capabilities() options &quot;GNOME&quot; and &quot;IEEE754&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew function casefold(), a wrapper for tolower/toupper\n\tprovided for compatibility with S-PLUS.\n\n    o\tcontour() is now generic.\n\n    o\tcor.test() in package ctest now also gives an asymptotic\n\tconfidence interval for the Pearson product moment correlation\n\tcoefficient.\n\n    o\tdata(), demo() and library() now also return the information\n\tabout available data sets, demos or packages.  Similarly,\n\thelp.search() returns its results.\n\n    o\tdensity() allows `bw' or `width' to specify a rule to choose the\n\tbandwidth, and rules &quot;nrd0&quot; (the previous default), &quot;nrd&quot;,\n\t&quot;ucv&quot;, &quot;bcv&quot;, &quot;SJ-ste&quot; and &quot;SJ-dpi&quot; are supplied (based on\n\tfunctions in package MASS).\n\n    o\tdf.residual() now has a default method, used for classes\n\t&quot;lm&quot; and &quot;glm&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew argument `cacheOK' to download.file() to request cache\n\tflushing.\n\n\tAll methods for download.file() do tilde-expansion on the path\n\tname.\n\n\tThe internal download.file() etc now allow URLs of the form\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://user@foo.bar/\">ftp://user@foo.bar/</A> and <A HREF=\"ftp://user:pass@foo.bar/\">ftp://user:pass@foo.bar/</A>\n\n    o\tduplicated() and unique() are now generic functions with\n\tmethods for data frames (as well as atomic vectors).\n\n    o\tfactanal() and princomp() use napredict() on their scores, so\n\tna.action = na.exclude is supported.\n\n    o\tFunction getNativeSymbolInfo() returns details about a native\n\troutine, potentially including its address, the library in\n\twhich it is located, the interface by which it can be called\n\tand the number of parameters.\n\n    o\tFunctions such as help() which perform library or package index\n\tsearches now use NULL as default for their `lib.loc' argument so\n\tthat missingness can be propagated more easily.\t The default\n\tcorresponds to all currently known libraries as before.\n\n    o\tAdded function file.rename().\n\n    o\thist.default() allows `breaks' to specify a rule to choose the\n\tnumber of classes, and rules &quot;Sturges&quot; (the previous default),\n\t&quot;Scott&quot; and &quot;FD&quot; (Freedman-Diaconis) are supplied (based on\n\tpackage MASS).\n\n    o\tFunction identical(), a fast and reliable way to test for exact\n\tequality of two objects.\n\n    o\tNew generic function is.na&lt;-(), from S4.  This is by default\n\tequivalent to x[value] &lt;- NA but may differ, e.g. for factors\n\twhere &quot;NA&quot; is a level.\n\n    o\tis.xxx reached through do_is are now generic.\n\n    o\tLa.eigen() and La.svd() have new default methods to use later\n\t(and often much faster) LAPACK routines.  The difference\n\tis most noticeable on systems with optimized BLAS libraries.\n\n    o\tlength() is now generic.\n\n    o\tNew function .libPaths() for getting or setting the paths to the\n\tlibrary trees R knows about.  This is still stored in .lib.loc,\n\twhich however should no longer be accessed directly.\n\n    o\tUsing lm/glm/... with `data' a matrix rather than a data frame\n\tnow gives a specific error message.\n\n    o\tloess(), lqs(), nls() and ppr() use the standard NA-handling\n\tand so support na.action = na.exclude.\n\n    o\tmahalanobis() now has a `tol' argument to be passed to solve().\n\n    o\tmean() has `data frame' method applying mean column-by-column.\n\tWhen applied to non-numeric data mean() now returns NA rather\n\tthan a confusing error message (for compatibility with S4).\n\tLogicals are still coerced to numeric.\n\n    o\tThe formula interface to mosaicplot() now allows a contingency\n\ttable as data argument.\n\n    o\tnew.env() is now internal and allows you to set hashing. Also,\n\tparent.env() and parent.env&lt;-() are included to provide direct\n\taccess to setting and retrieving environments.\n\n    o\tFunction nsl() to look up IP addresses of hosts: intended as\n\ta way to test for internet connectivity.\n\n    o\tOps(), cbind(), diff() and na.omit() methods for time series\n\tobjects moved from package ts to package base.\n\n    o\tNew option `download.file.method' can be used to set the\n\tdefault method for download.file() and functions which use it\n\tsuch as update.packages().\n\n    o\torder() and sort.list() now implement na.last = FALSE, NA.\n\n    o\tStarted work on new package management system: packageStatus()\n\tand friends.\n\n    o\tpage() has a new `method' argument allowing `method = print'.\n\n    o\tpng(), jpeg() and bmp() devices now have a `bg' argument to\n\tset the background color: useful to set &quot;transparent&quot; on png().\n\n    o\tChanges to the postscript() device:\n\n\t- The symbol font can now be set on a postscript() device, and\n\t  support has been added for using Computer Modern type-1\n\t  fonts (including for symbols). (Contributed by Brian D'Urso.)\n\n\t- There is now support for URW font families: this will give\n\t  access to more characters and more appropriate metrics on\n\t  PostScript devices using URW fonts (such as ghostscript).\n\n\t- %%IncludeResource comments have been added to the output.\n\t  (Contributed by Brian D'Urso.)\n\n    o\tpredict.ppr() now predicts on `newdata' containing NAs.\n\n    o\tprincomp() now has a formula interface.\n\n    o\treadChar() now returns what is available if fewer characters\n\tthan requested are on the file.\n\n    o\treadline() allows up to 256 chars for the prompt.\n\n    o\tread.table(), scan() and count.fields() have a new argument\n\t`comment.char', default `#', that can be used to start\n\tcomments on a line.\n\n    o\tNew function reg.finalizer() to provide R interface to\n\tfinalization.\n\n    o\treshape() extends reshapeLong, reshapeWide, which are deprecated.\n\n    o\trle() now returns a classed object, has a print method and\n\tan inverse.\n\n    o\tChanges to save() and friends:\n\n\t- save() now takes an envir argument for specifying where\n\t  items to be saved are to be found.\n\n\t- A new default format for saved workspaces has been\n\t  introduced.  This format provides support for some new\n\t  internal data types, produces smaller save files when saving\n\t  code, and provides a basis for a more flexible serialization\n\t  mechanism.\n\n\t- Modified `save' internals to improve performance when saving\n\t  large collections of code.\n\n\t- save() and save.image() now take a `version' argument to\n\t  specify the workspace file-format version to use.  The\n\t  version used from R 0.99.0 to 1.3.1 is version 1.  The new\n\t  default format is version 2.\tload() can read a version 2\n\t  saved workspace if it is compressed.\n\n\t- save() and save.image() now take a `compress' argument to\n\t  specify that the saved image should be written using the zlib\n\t  compression facilities.\n\n\t- save.image() now takes an argument `ascii'.\n\n\t- save.image() now takes an argument `safe'.  If TRUE, the\n\t  default, a temporary file is used for creating the saved\n\t  workspace.  The temporary file is renamed if the save\n\t  succeeds.  This preserves an existing workspace if the save\n\t  fails, but at the cost of using extra disk space during the\n\t  save.\n\n\t- save.image() default arguments can be specified in the\n\t  `save.image.defaults' option.\t These specifications are used\n\t  when save.image() is called from q() or GUI analogs.\n\n\n    o\tscan() allows unlimited (by R) lengths of input lines, instead\n\tof a limit of 8190 chars.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline() has a new `control.spar' argument and returns\n\t`lambda' besides `spar'.  spar &lt;= 0 is now valid and allows\n\tto go more closely towards interpolation (lambda -&gt; 0) than before.\n\tThis also fixes smooth.spline() behavior for &quot;df ~= n - 2&quot;. Better\n\terror messages in several situations.\n\n\tNote that spar = 0 is no longer the default and no longer entails\n\tcross-validation.\n\n    o\tstars() has been enhanced; new `mar' argument uses smaller\n\tmar(gins) by default; further `nrow and `ncol' as S-PLUS,\n\t`frame.plot', `flip.labels', `lty' and explicit `main', `sub',\n\t`xlab' and `ylab'.  Note that `colors' has been replaced by\n\t`col.segments' and there's a new `col.stars'.\n\n\tstars() now returns the locations invisibly.\n\n    o\tstep() is now closer to stepAIC() and so handles a wider range\n\tof objects (but stepAIC [in MASS] is still more powerful).\n\n    o\tsymbols() now has automatic xlab and ylab and a main argument\n\twhich eliminates an incorrect warning.\tIt better checks wrongly\n\tscaled arguments.\n\n    o\tSys.setlocale() now issues a warning if it fails.\n\n    o\tAn enhanced function type.convert() is now a documented\n\tfunction, rather than just internal to read.table().\n\n    o\twarning() allows multiple arguments, following S4's style.\n\n    o\tNew function with() for evaluating expressions in environments\n\tconstructed from data.\n\n    o\tUnix x11() devices can now have a canvas color set, which can\n\thelp to distinguish plotting &quot;white&quot; from plotting\n\t&quot;transparent&quot;.\n\n    o\tOn Unix, X11(), png() and jpeg() now give informative warnings\n\tif they fail to open the device.\n\n\n    o\tThe startup processing now interprets escapes in the values of\n\tenvironment variables set in R_HOME/etc/Renviron in a similar\n\tway to most shells.\n\n    o\tThe operator &quot;=&quot; is now allowed as an assignment\n\toperator in the grammar, for consistency with other languages,\n\tincluding recent versions of S-Plus.  Assignments with &quot;=&quot; are\n\tbasically allowed only at top-level and in braced or\n\tparenthesized expressions, to make famous errors such as\n\t&quot;if(x=0) 1 else 2&quot; illegal in the grammar.\n\t(There is a plan to gradually eliminate the underscore as an\n\tassignment in future versions of R.)\n\n    o\tFinalizers can be registered to be run on system exit for both\n\treachable and unreachable objects.\n\n    o\tinteger addition, subtraction, and multiplication now return NA's\n\ton overflow and issue a warning.\n\n    o\tPrinting factors with both level &quot;NA&quot; and missing values\n\tuses `&lt;NA&gt;' for the missing values to distinguish them.\n\n    o\tAdded an experimental interface for locking environments and\n\tindividual bindings.  Also added support for &quot;active bindings&quot;\n\tthat link a variable to a function (useful for example for linking\n\tan R variable to an internal C global).\n\n    o\tGNOME interface now has separate colours for input and output\n\ttext (like the windows GUI). These can be modified via the\n\tproperties dialogue.\n\n    o\tOutput from the GNOME console is block buffered for increased\n\tspeed\n\n    o\tThe GNOME console inherits standard emacs-style keyboard\n\tshortcuts from the GtkText widget for cursor motion, editing\n\tand selection.\tThese have been modified to allow for the prompt\n\tat the beginning of the command line.\n\n    o\tOne can register R functions and C routines to be called at the\n\tend of the successful evaluation of each top-level expression,\n\tfor example to perform auto-saves, update displays, etc. See\n\taddTaskCallback() and taskCallbackManager(). See\n\t<A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org/TaskHandlers.pdf.\">http://developer.r-project.org/TaskHandlers.pdf.</A>\n\n\nDEPRECATED &amp; DEFUNCT\n\n    o\t.Alias has been removed from all R sources and deprecated.\n\n    o\treshapeLong(), reshapeWide() are deprecated in favour of reshape().\n\n    o\tPreviously deprecated functions read.table.url(), scan.url(),\n\tsource.url(), httpclient() and parse.dcf() are defunct.\n\tMethod &quot;socket&quot; for download.file() no longer exists.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION CHANGES\n\n    o\t`Writing R Extensions' has a new chapter on generic/method\n\tfunctions.\n\n\nUTILITIES\n\n    o\tNew package `tools' for package development and administration\n\ttools, containing the QA tools checkFF(), codoc() and undoc()\n\tpreviously in package base, as well as the following new ones:\n\n\t-  checkAssignFuns() for checking whether the final argument of\n\t   assignment functions in a package is named `value'.\n\n\t-  checkDocArgs() for checking whether all arguments shown in\n\t   \\usage of Rd files are documented in the corresponding\n\t   \\arguments.\n\n\t-  checkMethods() for checking whether all methods defined in a\n\t   package have all arguments of their generic.\n\n\t-  checkTnF() for finding expressions containing the symbols `T'\n\t   and `F'.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rd2dvi has more convenient defaults for its output file.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now also fully checks the Depends field in the\n\tpackage DESCRIPTION file.  It also tests for syntax errors in\n\tthe R code, whether all methods in the code have all arguments\n\tof the corresponding generic, for arguments shown in \\usage but\n\tnot documented in \\arguments, and whether assignment functions\n\thave their final argument named `value'.\n\n\nC-LEVEL FACILITIES\n\n    o\tarraySubscript and vectorSubscript are now available to package\n\tusers.\tAll &quot;array-like&quot; packages can use a standard method for\n\tcalculating subscripts.\n\n    o\tThe C routine type2symbol, similar to type2str, returns a symbol\n\tcorresponding to the type supplied as an argument.\n\n    o\tThe macro SHLIB_EXT now includes `.', e.g. &quot;.so&quot; or &quot;.dll&quot;,\n\tsince the Mac uses &quot;Lib&quot; without a `.'.\n\n    o\tNew Fortran entry points rwarn() and rexit() for warnings and\n\terror exits from compiled Fortran code.\n\n    o\tA new serialization mechanism is available that can be used to\n\tserialize R objects to connections or to strings.  This\n\tmechanism is used for the version 2 save format.  For now,\n\tonly an internal C interface is available.\n\n    o\tR_tryEval() added for evaluating expressions from C code with\n\terrors handled but guaranteed to return to the calling C\n\troutine.

Also, packages\n\tloaded by require() when sourcing package code are now visible\n\tin the remaining source evaluations.\n\n    o\tnames(d) &lt;- v  now works (again) for &quot;dist&quot; objects d.

(PR#1146)\n\n    o\tThe [pqr]signrank and [pqr]wilcox functions failed to check that\n\tmemory has been allocated (PR#1149), and had (often large)\n\tmemory leaks if interrupted.  They now can be interrupted on\n\tWindows and MacOS and don't leak memory.\n\n    o\trange(numeric(0)) is now c(NA, NA) not NA.\n\n    o\tround(x, digits) for digits &lt;= 0 always gives an integral\n\tanswer.\t Previously it might not due to rounding errors in\n\tfround.

(Caused the fifo example to fail on HP-UX.)\n\n    o\tOutput over 1024 characters was discarded from the GNOME\n\tconsole.\n\n    o\trug() now correctly warns about clipped values also for logarithmic\n\taxes and has a `quiet' argument for suppressing these (PR#1188).\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix.default was not handling correctly contrasts.arg\n\twhich did not supply a full set of contrasts (PR#1187).\n\n    o\tThe `width' argument of density() was only compatible with S\n\tfor a Gaussian kernel: now it is compatible in all cases.\n\n    o\tThe rbinom() C code had a transcription error from the original\n\tFortran which led to a small deviation from the intended\n\tdistribution. (PR#1190)\n\n    o\tpt(t, , ncp=0) was wrong if t was +/-Inf.\n\n    o\tSubsetting grouping factors gave incorrect degrees of freedom\n\tfor some tests in package ctests.

This is a minor upgrade,\nfixing a number of bugs and only containing a few small new features.\nThe most immediately visible new feature is that &quot;less&quot; is used for\nviewing help pages if available.\n\nA set of recommended packages which have been tested with R-1.3.1 has\nbeen bundled up. Binary distributions are expected to include these\npackages. The mgcv package is included this time (we intended to have\nit in 1.3.0, but encountered portability problems).\n\nPlease note (as for 1.3.0) that the former &quot;survival5&quot; package is now\nnamed &quot;survival&quot;. If you install over an existing installation which\nhas survival5 installed, make sure to &quot;R CMD REMOVE survival5&quot;\n\nYou can get the files from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1-recommended.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.1-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you. This will\nprobably happen after the weekend due to circumstances in Vienna.\nBinaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies, and a patch file relative\nto R-1.3.0.\n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   massage-examples is now a Perl script and about 50x faster.\n\n    o   On Unix(-alike) systems the default pager is now determined\n        during configuration, and is `less' if available, otherwise\n        `more' (and not `more -s' as previously).\n\n    o   configure now tests for strptime functions that fail on inputs\n        before 1970 (found on Irix).  It no longer checks for the SCSL\n        and SGIMATH libraries on Irix.\n\n    o   New formula interface to cor.test() in package ctest.\n\n    o   &quot;NA&quot; is now a valid color name (as NA has been a valid integer\n        color).\n\n    o   pairs() function has a new `gap' argument for adjusting the\n        spacing between panels.\n\n    o   R CMD check has a new test for unbalanced braces in Rd files.\n\n    o   readBin() has a new argument `signed' to simplify reading\n        unsigned 8- and 16-bit integers.\n\n    o   New capabilities() option &quot;cledit&quot;.\n\n    o   Modified restore code to give clearer error messages in some cases.\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Fixed placement of mtext() output (including tick labels)\n        when text is perpendicular to axis AND axis is logged\n        (PR#997 and PR#865).\n\n    o   rect() and arrows() now respond to setting of par(xpd)\n\n    o   abline() now responds to the setting of par(xpd), including\n        via the &quot;...&quot; argument (PR#750).\n\n    o   Using cat() to a gzfile() connection no longer compresses poorly\n        (at the expense of some latency).\n\n    o   The `exact' p-values for the two-sided two-sample\n        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in 1.3.0 were for the wrong tail.\n\n    o   In the HTML conversion of .Rd files, \\link[foo]{bar} was\n        ignoring [foo] outside \\code{} statements.\n\n    o   lm.influence(), plot.lm(), influence.measures() and the\n        related diagnostic measures now handle lm() fits with\n        na.action=na.exclude.\n\n    o   Eliminated segmentation fault in while loops without braces\n        in their bodies.\n\n    o   barplot did not accept NA heights unless ylim was specified.\n\n    o   predict.lm() failed with single-column model matrix (PR#1018).\n\n    o   legend() now also works with 100s of entries (thanks to\n        M. Schlather).\n\n    o   A long-standing bug leading to inaccuracy in polyroot() has been\n        fixed (PR#751)\n\n    o   A very old bug with eval() not handling a numeric `envir' argument\n        according to specifications has been fixed. [This in particular\n        broke ported S-PLUS code that used eval(..., sys.parent())]. Also,\n        eval() now checks that a numeric `envir' has length one to prevent\n        accidental passing of matrices instead of data frames.\n\n    o   The C code underlying nlm(f, *) now also works correctly when f(x)\n        returns +Inf {nlm() itself *did* work!}.\n\n    o   pdfcolor.tex is now included in doc/manual, as pdftex seems no\n        longer to include it.\n\n    o   Fixed protect bug in save() code that might have been responsible\n        for occasionally saving corrupted workspaces.\n\n    o   capabilities(&quot;X11&quot;) now reports if X11 is available in this\n        session, thereby giving the correct answer if --gui=none was\n        specified.\n\n    o   Rd files with ,, inside \\code{} were treating this as a\n        ligature in LaTeX: now corrected in Rdconv.\n\n    o   dlopen on Compaq Tru64 was finding the wrong entry points:\n        worked-around by using different names in the modules.\n\n    o   plot.mts() allows a type argument again (broken in 1.3.0: PR#1010).\n\n    o   scan() has a limit of 8190 on the length of char strings, and\n        now warns if it is exceeded (when the string has always been\n        truncated).\n\n    o   par adj now accepts values of integer mode (such as text(adj=0:1)).\n\n    o   horizontal adj values outside the range [0, 1] are now\n        supported on devices with canHAdj==1 (Windows devices, xfig).\n\n    o   xtabs() without a response was ignoring drop.unused.levels=TRUE.\n\n    o   readLines(ok=FALSE) was not generating an error when it should.\n\n    o   princomp(covmat=) has been broken.\n\n    o   Many documentation clean-ups: formerly undocumented arguments,\n        use of T/F rather than TRUE/FALSE.\n\n    o   df[] &lt;- foo now works for data frames (PR#1047).\n\n    o   nargs() was documented incorrectly.\n\n    o   Using seq.POSIXt(by=&quot;2 weeks&quot;) was stepping by single weeks\n        (PR#1046).\n\n    o   dummy.coef.lm was not handling complex terms like z:I(x).\n        It now either does or warns and gives NAs (PR#1048).\n\n    o   predict.mlm() was broken (PR#1049).\n\n    o   ksmooth (in package modreg) was using points to the left\n        of the kernel under some circumstances (PR#1050).\n\n    o   attr(x, &quot;class&quot;) &lt;- character(0) was segfaulting.  Similar problem\n        with &quot;comment&quot; attribute also fixed.\n\n    o   loadings() results from PCA (as well as from factor analysis)\n        are now printed by print.loadings.\n\n    o   Using chol() on an non-positive-definite matrix gave an\n        misleading error message (PR#1061).\n\n    o   as.character() on a language object was truncating to about 70\n        characters: the internal limit (from the deparse code) is now the\n        maximum possible 500.\n\n    o   X11() device was failing to re-initialize correctly after all\n        devices were shut down, so the colortype could not be changed\n        and some systems showed protocol errors. (PR#1065)\n\n    o   Converting Inf and NaN values by as.character() and reading by\n        scan() was supported by strtod on some platforms and not\n        others: these are now handled by R itself. (PR#1072)\n\n    o   hclust(dist(1)) doesn't loop infinitely but signal an error.\n\n    o   cutree() can now cut outside heights and does not return\n        garbage for h &gt;= max(tree$heights) anymore. (PR#1067)\n\n    o   interaction(...,drop=F) returned an object looking like a\n        factor, but with storage mode &quot;double&quot;, confusing\n        model.matrix.default (PR#1003)\n\n    o   splineDesign(*, ord=) and others give better error messages for\n        wrong `ord' (and have slightly improved documentation).\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This is a major upgrade,\nwith some structural changes and major new features, especially in the\nareas of connections, dates, and the ctest package.\n\nAs a new item, we also roll up (in a separate file) a set of\nrecommended packages that are known to work with R-1.3.0. Binary\ndistributions are expected to include these packages. \n\nPlease note that the former &quot;survival5&quot; package is now named\n&quot;survival&quot;. If you install over an existing installation, make sure to\n&quot;R CMD REMOVE survival5&quot;\n\nYou can get it from the developer site\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0.tgz</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-1.3.0-recommended.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for them to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day\nor two. Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.\n\nThere are also versions split for floppies.\n\n(Are anyone actually using the split-source versions and not capable\nof using the &quot;split&quot; command themselves? They do take up a lot of\nspace, and I had to remove split versions of earlier releases to make\nroom for the new one.) \n\n\n        For the R Core Team,\n\n        Peter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.0\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tChanges to connections:\n\n\t-  New function url() to read from URLs.  file() will also\n\t   accept URL specifications, as will all the functions which\n\t   use it.\n\n\t-  file connections can now be opened for both reading and writing.\n\n\t-  Anonymous file connections (via file()) are now supported.\n\n\t-  New function gzfile() to read from / write to compressed files.\n\n\t-  New function fifo() for connections to / from fifos (on Unix).\n\n\t-  Text input from file, pipe, fifo, gzfile and url connections\n\t   can be read with a user-specified encoding.\n\n\t-  New functions readChar() and writeChar() to read character\n\t   strings with known lengths and no terminators, and to write\n\t   user-specified lengths from strings.\n\n\t-  sink() now has a stack of output connections, following S4.\n\n\t-  sink() can also be applied to the message stream, to capture\n\t   error messages to a connection.  Use carefully!\n\n\t-  seek() has a new `origin' argument.\n\n\t-  New function truncate() to truncate a connection open for\n\t   writing at the current position.\n\n\t-  Socket connections via function socketConnection().\n\n\t-  The `blocking' argument for file, fifo  and socket connections\n\t   is now operational.\n\n    o\tChanges to date/time classes and functions:\n\n\t-  Date/time objects now all inherit from class &quot;POSIXt&quot;.\n\n\t-  New function difftime() and corresponding class for date/time\n\t   differences, and a round() method.\n\n\t-  Subtraction and logical comparison of objects from different\n\t   date/time classes is now supported.\tNB: the format for the\n\t   difference of two objects of the same date/time class has\n\t   changed, but only for objects generated by this version, not\n\t   those generated by earlier ones.\n\n\t-  Methods for cut(), seq(), round() and trunc() for date/time\n\t   classes.\n\n\t-  Convenience generic functions weekdays(), months(), quarters()\n\t   and julian() with methods for &quot;POSIXt&quot; objects.\n\n    o\tCoercion from real to integer now gives NA for out-of-range\n\tvalues, rather than the most extreme integer of the same sign.\n\n    o\tThe Ansari-Bradley, Bartlett, Fligner-Killeen, Friedman,\n\tKruskal-Wallis, Mood, Quade, t, and Wilcoxon tests as well as\n\tvar.test() in package ctest now have formula interfaces.\n\n    o\tMatrix multiplication functions %*% and crossprod() now use a\n\tlevel-3 BLAS routine dgemm.  When R is linked with the ATLAS\n\tor other enhanced BLAS libraries this can be substantially\n\tfaster than the previous code.\n\n    o\tNew functions La.eigen() and La.svd() for eigenvector and\n\tsingular value decompositions, based on LAPACK.\t These are\n\tpreferred to eigen() and svd() for new projects and can make\n\tuse of enhanced BLAS routines such as ATLAS.  They are\n\tused in cancor(), cmdscale(), factanal() and princomp()\n\tand this may lead to sign reversals in some of the output of\n\tthose functions.\n\n    o\tProvided the Fortran compiler can handle COMPLEX*16, the\n\tfollowing routines now handle complex arguments, based on\n\tLAPACK code.\n\n\tqr, qr.coef, qr.solve, qr.qy, qr.qty, solve.default, svd, La.svd.\n\n\n\n    o\taperm() uses strides in the internal C code and so is\n\tsubstantially faster (by Jonathan Rougier).\n\n    o\tThe four bessel[IJKY](x,nu) functions are now defined for nu &lt; 0.\n\n    o\t[dpqr]nbinom also accept an alternative parametrization via the\n\tmean and the dispersion parameter (thanks to Ben Bolker).\n\n    o\tGeneralised &quot;birthday paradox&quot; functions [pq]birthday.\n\n    o\tboxplot() and bxp() have a new argument `at'\n\n    o\tNew function capabilities() to report optional capabilities\n\tsuch as jpeg, png, tcltk, gzfile and url support.\n\n    o\tNew function checkFF() for checking foreign function calls.\n\n    o\tNew function col2rgb() for color conversion of names, hex, or\n\tinteger.\n\n    o\tcoplot() has a new argument `bar.bg' (color of conditioning bars),\n\tgives nicer plots when the conditioners are factors, and allows\n\tfactors for x and y (treated almost as if unclass()ed) using new\n\targument `axlabels'.  [original ideas by Thomas Baummann]\n\n    o\t`hessian' argument added to deriv() and its methods.  A new function\n\tderiv3() provides identical capabilities to deriv() except that\n\t`hessian' is TRUE by default.\n\tderiv(*, *, func = TRUE) for convenience.\n\n    o\tNew dev.interactive() function, useful for setting defaults for\n\tpar(ask=*) in multifigure plots.\n\n    o\tdist() in package mva can now handle missing values, and\n\tzeroes in the Canberra distance.\n\n    o\tThe default method for download.file() (and functions which use\n\tit such as update.packages()) is now &quot;internal&quot;, and uses code\n\tcompiled into R.\n\n    o\teigen() tests for symmetry with a numerical tolerance.\n\n    o\tNew function formatDL() for formatting description lists.\n\n    o\tNew argument `nsmall' to format.default(), for S-PLUS\n\tcompatibility (and used in various packages).\n\n    o\t?/help() now advertises help.search() if it fails to find a topic.\n\n    o\timage() is now a generic function.\n\n    o\tNew function integrate() with S-compatible call.\n\n    o\tNew function is.unsorted() the C version of which also speeds up\n\t.Internal(sort()) for sorted input.\n\n    o\tis.loaded() accepts an argument PACKAGE to search within\n\ta specific DLL/shared library.\n\n    o\tExact p-values are available for the two-sided two-sample\n\tKolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\n    o\tlm() now passes `...' to the low level functions for regression\n\tfitting.\n\n    o\tGeneric functions logLik() and AIC() moved from packages nls\n\tand nlme to base, as well as their *.lm methods.\n\n    o\tNew components in .Machine give the sizes of long, long long and\n\tlong double C types (or 0 if they do not exist).\n\n    o\tmerge.data.frame() has new arguments, `all[.xy]' and `suffixes',\n\tfor S compatibility.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() now calls na.action with the terms attribute set\n\ton the data frame (needed to distiguish the response, for\n\texample).\n\n    o\tNew generic functions naresid(), napredict() and naprint()\n\t(formerly in packages survival5 and MASS, also used in rpart).\n\tAlso na.exclude(), a variant on na.omit() that is handled\n\tdifferently by naresid() and napredict().\n\n\tThe default, lm and glm methods for fitted, residuals, predict\n\tand weights make use of these.\n\n    o\tNew function oneway.test() in package ctest for testing for\n\tequal means in a one-way layout, assuming normality but not\n\tnecessarily equal variances.\n\n    o\toptions(error) accepts a function, as an alternative to\n\tan expression.\t(The Blue Book only allows a function; current\n\tS-PLUS a function or an expression.)\n\n    o\touter() has a speed-up in the default case of a matrix outer\n\tproduct (by Jonathan Rougier).\n\n    o\tpackage.skeleton() helps with creating new packages.\n\n    o\tNew pdf() graphics driver.\n\n    o\tpersp() is now a generic function.\n\n    o\tplot.acf() makes better use of white space for `nser &gt; 2', has\n\tnew optional arguments and uses a much better layout when more\n\tthan one page of plots is produced.\n\n    o\tplot.mts() has a new argument `panel' providing the same\n\tfunctionality as in coplot().\n\n    o\tpostscript() allows user-specified encoding, with encoding files\n\tsupplied for Windows, Mac, Unicode and various others, and with\n\tan appropriate platform-specific default.\n\n    o\tprint.htest() can now handle test names that are longer than\n\tone line.\n\n    o\tprompt() improved for data sets, particularly non-dataframes.\n\n    o\tqqnorm() is now a generic function.\n\n    o\tread.fwf() has a new argument `n' for specifying the number of\n\trecords (lines) read in.\n\n    o\tread.table() now uses a single pass through the dataset.\n\n    o\trep() now handles lists (as generic vectors).\n\n    o\tscan() has a new argument `multi.line' for S compatibility,\n\tbut the default remains the opposite of S (records can cross\n\tline boundaries by default).\n\n    o\tsort(x) now produces an error when x is not atomic instead of\n\tjust returning x.\n\n    o\tsplit() now allows splitting on a list of factors in which case\n\ttheir interaction defines the grouping.\n\n    o\tstl() has more optional arguments for fine tuning, a summary()\n\tand an improved plot() method.\n\n    o\tNew function strwrap() for formatting character strings into\n\tparagraphs.\n\n    o\tNew replacement functions substr&lt;-() and substring&lt;-().\n\n    o\tDataset swiss now has row names.\n\n    o\tArguments `pkg' and `lib' of system.file() have been renamed to\n\t`package' and `lib.loc', respectively, to be consistent with\n\trelated functions.  The old names are deprecated.  Argument\n\t`package' must now specify a single package.\n\n    o\tThe Wilcoxon and Ansari-Bradley tests now return point\n\testimators of the location or scale parameter of interest along\n\twith confidence intervals for these.\n\n    o\tNew function write.dcf() for writing data in Debian Control File\n\tformat.\t parse.dcf() has been replaced by (much faster)\tinternal\n\tread.dcf().\n\n    o\tContingency tables created by xtabs() or table() now have a\n\tsummary() method.\n\n    o\tFunctions httpclient(), read.table.url(), scan.url() and\n\tsource.url() are now deprecated, and hence method=&quot;socket' in\n\tdownload.file() is.  Use url connections instead: in\n\tparticular URLs can be specified for read.table(), scan() and\n\tsource().\n\n    o\tFormerly deprecated function getenv() is now defunct.\n\n    o\tSupport for package-specific demo scripts (R code).  demo() now\n\thas new arguments to specify the location of demos and to allow\n\tfor running base demos as part of `make check'.\n\n    o\tIf not explicitly given a library tree to install to or remove\n\tfrom, respectively, R CMD INSTALL and R CMD REMOVE now operate\n\ton the first directory given in `R_LIBS' if this is set and\n\tnon-null, and the default library otherwise.\n\n    o\tR CMD INSTALL and package.description() fix some common problems\n\tof DESCRIPTION files (blank lines, ...)\n\n    o\tThe INSTALL command for package installation allows a `--save'\n\toption.\t Using it causes a binary image of the package contents\n\tto be created at install time and loaded when the package is\n\tattached.  This saves time, but also uses a more standard way\n\tof source-ing the package.  Packages that do more than just\n\tassign object definitions may need to install with `--save'.\n\tPutting a file `INSTALL.R' in the package directory makes\n\t`--save' the default behavior.  If that file is not empty, its\n\tcontents should be R commands executed at the end of creating\n\tthe image.\n\n\tThere is also a new command line option `--configure-vals' for\n\tpassing variables to the configure script of a package.\n\n    o\tR CMD check now also checks the keyword entries against the list\n\tof standard keywords, for code/documentation mismatches (this\n\tcan be turned off by the command line option `--no-codoc'), and\n\tfor sufficient file permissions (Unix only).  There is a new check\n\tfor the correct usage of library.dynam.\n\n\tIt also has a new command line option `--use-gct' to use\n\t`gctorture(TRUE)' when running R code.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rd2dvi has better support for producing reference manuals\n\tfor packages and package bundles.\n\n    o\tconfigure now tests for the versions of jpeg (&gt;= 6b), libpng (&gt;=\n\t1.0.5) and zlib (&gt;= 1.1.3).  It no longer checks for the\n\tCXML/DXML BLAS libraries on Alphas.\n\n    o\tPerl scripts now use Cwd::cwd() in place of Cwd::getcwd(), as\n\tcwd() can be much faster.\n\n    o\tR::Dcf.pm can now also handle files with more than one record\n\tand checks (a little bit) for continuation lines without leading\n\twhitespace.\n\n    o\tNew manual `R Installation and Administration' with fuller\n\tdetails on the installation process: file `INSTALL' is now a\n\tbrief introduction referencing that manual.\n\n    o\tNew keyword `internal' which can be used to hide objects that\n\tare not part of the API from indices like the alphabetical lists\n\tin the HTML help system.\n\n    o   Under Unix, shlib modules for add-on packages are now linked\n\tagainst R as a shared library (`libR') if this exists.  (This\n\tallows for improved embedding of R into other applications.)\n\n    o   New mechanism for explicitly registering native routines in a\n\tDLL/shared library accessible via .C(), .Call(), .Fortran() and\n\t.External().  This is potentially more robust than the existing\n\tdynamic lookup, since it checks the number of arguments, type of\n\tthe routine.\n\n    o\tNew mechanism allowing registration of C routines for converting\n\tR objects to C pointers in .C() calls.  Useful for references to\n\tdata in other languages and libraries (e.g. C and hdf5).\n\n    o\tThe internal ftp/http access code maintains the event loop, so\n\tyou can download whilst running tcltk or Rggobi, say.  It can\n\tbe hooked into package XML too.\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tboxplot.stats() now returns the correct `n' component in the case of\n\tNAs. This also affects `conf', the notch length (PR#967).\n\n    o\tthe &quot;coef = 0&quot; fix (PR#917) to boxplot.stats() broke\n\tboxplot.stats(do.out = FALSE).\n\n    o\tcurve(* , add = FALSE) now works correctly again if used when\n\tpar(&quot;xlog&quot;) is true.\n\n    o\tPrinting a dataframe with a column called &quot;row.names&quot; or\n\t&quot;check.names&quot; omitted the column.\n\n    o\tdata.frame(a=1, b=2)[1, -(1:2)]\t now works, giving an empty\n\tdata frame.  as.matrix(df), deparse(), dput() and str() now work\n\tfor empty data frames.\n\n    o\tdbeta() could return zero erroneously on some platforms where\n\troundoff makes e.g. 1.3 - 1 &gt; (1.3 + 1) - 2 (Solaris and HP-UX\n\twere affected). (PR#970)\n\n    o\tpointer protection in deriv() (PR#953)\n\n    o   expand.data.frame() didn't interpret its subset= argument in\n        the data frame. (PR#979 et al., fix from Greg Warnes)\n\n    o\tformat() on character arrays was losing the dimensions.\n\n    o\thist.default() was ignoring its `probability' argument for\n\tequi-spaced breaks.\n\n    o\tOccasionally insane results of is.nan(NULL), is.na(NULL) (PR#952)\n\n    o\tks.test() in package ctest now had the one-sided alternatives in\n\tthe one-sample case reversed (PR#934).\n\n    o\tls.str() and lsf.str() now work better with pos &gt; 1, and are\n\tcorrectly documented (PR#899).\n\n    o\tplot(1:2, xaxs = &quot;i&quot;) now gives both &quot;1.0&quot; and &quot;2.0&quot; x-axis labels.\n\n    o\tpromax() was not using its `m' argument (m=4 was always used).\n\n    o\tqr.X() was ignoring pivoting (which happens only in\n\trank-deficient cases).\n\n    o   sign of Pearson residuals was wrong for reciprocal link (PR#862)\n\n    o\tThe algorithm for determining starting estimates in the SSfpl\n\tself-starting model in the nls package was changed following a\n\tsuggestion by Phillipe Grosjean &lt;<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">phgrosje at ulb.ac.be</A>&gt;\n\n    o\tsvd(x)$v was not a matrix when x had only 1 row (PR#963).\n\n    o\tsymnum(x) behaves more reasonably for zero length or non-numeric x.\n\n    o\tThe implementation of sys.function() did not work when the\n\tcurrent function was already a function (e.g., a closure).\n\n    o   tapply() had &quot;...&quot; argument after simplify=, which made it\n\tincompatible with S when passing additional unnamed arguments to FUN.\n\n    o   use formula environments in xy.coords() (PR#932)\n\n\n    o\tUnused entry points in `src/appl/fortran.c' and `Fortran.h'\n\thave been removed.\n\n    o\tUnused directory `src/f2clib' and header `src/include/R_ext/f2c.h'\n\thave been removed.\n\n    o\tThe documentation and parts of the parse/deparse mechanism\n\tindicated that there was an operator `%'. Corrected (PR#925).\n\n    o\tFixed some cases where the deparser gave code that threw a\n\tsyntax error when parsed.\n\n    o\tUsing a pushback with more than two lines at a time could crash.\n\n    o\tEliminate or warn on use of .Last.value in help examples, since\n\t.Last.value is only set from top-level expressions (and was\n\tincorrectly documented).\n\n    o\tasInteger was ignoring integer overflow (PR#929 and others).\n\n    o\tapproxfun(*, ties = &lt;fun&gt;) could return garbage when there were ties;\n\tties = &quot;ordered&quot; was incorrect--also for approx()-- when there was\n\ta tie at the very right.\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This not likely to be\nof consequence to anyone, but drop us a note if it bothers you.)\n\n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.3\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tSupport for configuration and building the Unix version of R\n\tunder Mac OS X.\t (The `classic' Macintosh port is `Carbonized'\n\tand also runs under that OS.)\n\n    o\tdotchart() and stripchart() become the preferred names for\n\tdotplot() and stripplot(), respectively.  The old names are now\n\tdeprecated.\n\n    o\tFunctions in package ctest now consistently use +/-Inf rather\n\tthan NA for one-sided confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\t`Writing R Extensions' incorrectly described an entry point\n\t`fmod' which was not included in the R binary on most systems.\n\tThe entry point has been removed, to avoid any confusion with\n\tthe standard C entry point of the same name.\n\n    o\tPrinting of kernels in package ts was unreliable: the internal\n\trepresentation was correct.\n\n    o\tA problem with &quot;...&quot; in substitutions has been fixed (PR#860).\n\n    o\tVarious strangeness with match.call() and &quot;...&quot; has been fixed\n\t(PR#813).\n\n    o\tsys.function() could return an unevaluated promise, messing up\n\tformals() and match.arg() (PR#872)\n\n    o\tDeparsing or dumping attributes with non-standard names was\n\tnot quoting the name (PR#871).\n\n    o\tWe now use match.fun() in tapply() so that it won't get trapped\n\tby non-functions masking FUN.\n\n    o\tThe `nmax' argument in scan(what=list(...), nmax=300) was\n\tcounting blank lines, although they were said to be ignored.\n\tThis affected using read.table on files with blank lines in\n\t1.2.2, and using `n' with `what' a list.\n\n    o\tas.numeric(), as.integer(), as.complex() returned zero on\n\tcompletely blank strings. Now they return NA. (PR#870)\n\n    o\tOverflow in deparse() in terms(formula) with very long left-hand\n\tside fixed.  (PR#873)\n\n    o\tlowess(c(1:3, 7:5)) now should give the same on different platforms,\n\tsince now in the C code (int)(f*n + 1e-7) is used.\n\n    o\tcurve(*, add = TRUE) now works properly with active log scales.\n\n    o\trt() could give different results on different platforms as\n\tthe order of evaluation of calls to random numbers was not\n\tfully defined.\tThis affected the Mac port.\n\n    o\tppr() inside nested calls sometimes failed to find objects\n\tdue to a typo in the eval call in ppr.formula.\n\n    o\tqchisq(0.025, 31, ncp=1, lower.tail=FALSE) now works.

(PR#883).\n\n    o\t?smooth.spline now properly describes `spar' which is *not*\n\tlambda.\t smooth.spline(1:20, spar = 50) gives an error instead\n\tof silent nonsense.  print.smooth.spline() now makes use of a\n\tdigits argument.\n\n    o\tConfidence intervals for wilcox.test() had the samples reversed\n\tin the two-sided case (PR#895), and sometimes got continuity\n\tcorrection wrong (PR#896).\n\n    o\tUsing out-of-range font values in text() on a postscript()\n\tdevice on Windows could crash.\t.ps.prolog was incorrectly\n\tnamed in some of the documentation.  (PR#914)\n\n    o\tWarning messages of &gt; 8191 chars could crash R (PR#902), as\n\tcould errors.  Now they are truncated to 8191 chars on\n\tmachines which have vsnprintf (almost all).\n\n    o\trange() now works properly for date-time objects.\n\n    o\tcontour() could loop infinitely (PR#897).\n\n    o\tR-lang manual had precedence of %% wrong (PR#879).\n\n    o\ttry() constructs lost protection of R_alloc'ed memory (PR#877).\n\n    o\tDocumented that as.numeric() dispatches to as.double.foo methods\n\t(PR#918.1).\n\n    o\thttpclient() (and the &quot;socket&quot; method of download.file) skipped ^V\n\trather than ^Z in input (if drop.ctrl.z = TRUE, the default).\n    \n    o\tboxplot(*, range = 0) and boxplot.stats(*, coef = 0) now\n\tdon't return outliers anymore (PR#917).\n\n    o   segmentation fault with tmp[[1,]] (PR#904)\n\n    o   incorrect &quot;...&quot; handling in plot.factor (PR#830)\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This affected the way they were printed on\n\tWindows, for example.\n\n    o\tlegend() now draws points after lines allowing &quot;empty dots on\n\tlines&quot; thanks to Ben Bolker.\n\n    o\tSetting row/column names preserves the names of the dimnames\n\t(PR#809). \n\n    o\tUsing help() after help.start() on Unix was failing to find\n\tthe linked help files if more than one package was loaded (as\n\tnow happens by default).\n\n    o\tscan now sets the maximal sizes internally when `what' is a list\n\tfrom `nmax' and failing that `nlines'.\tThis uses memory much\n\tmore efficiently if `nmax' is specified.  read.table() makes use\n\tof this.\n\n    o\tThe FORTRAN code used is now much closer to ANSI compliance.\n\n    o\tcov.rob() gives a useful error message on nearly-degenerate\n\tmatrices.\n\n    o\tsummary() on a data frame was computing results to a precision\n\tbased on options(&quot;digits&quot;) (default 4), not its `digits'\n\targument.  Now results are computed to full precision but \n\tformatted using `digits'.\n\n    o\tsummary(m, digits=*) also properly works for matrices.\n\n    o\tWhen returning parameters from .C/.Fortran, the OBJECT field was\n\tnot copied even though class attributes were (PR#834).\n\n    o\tThere was a spurious warning from the X11 driver on 100 dpi\n\tdisplays (PR#840, fix from Tom Vogels).\n\n    o\tscan() was reading all-blank numeric fields as zero. \n\tShould be read as NA, and are now. \n\n    o\tdnbinom(*, size, *) now works again for size &lt; 1 (PR#842).\n\n    o\tdgeom(*, p = 0) and pgeom(*, p = 0) don't give NaN anymore.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline() allows zero weights again.\n\n    o\taperm() fix for list arg; aperm(*, resize=FALSE) now works with\n\tdimnames (by dropping them).\n\n    o\tThe xfig() driver was not closing unclosed polygons as the R\n\tdriver expected (but did not document).\n\n    o\tspec.ar() now handles order 1 correctly.\n\n    o\tAdd fuzz to prevent anomalies with hist().\n\n    o\tprint.matrix() checks length of rowlab, collab (PR#850)\n\n    o\tadd1.glm() was using the wrong weights for binomial glms in\n\tcbind(successes, failures) ~ lhs  form, since 1.2.0.\n\n    o\tEliminate packing of the `structRstart' structure, which was\n\tprobably non-ISO C and caused some compilers problems (PR#852).\n\n    o\tall.vars() no longer returns empty `names' (PR#829).\n\n    o\tdotplot() passes `cex' down to the mtext() calls used for the\n\tlabels (PR#816).\n\n    o\tThe pictex() driver was drawing polylines incorrectly (PR#845).\n\n    o\tIn the event of a fatal X11 error (this can be generated under FVWM\n\tby selecting Destroy), the input handler would loop, leaving the\n\t&quot;please save work and shut down R&quot; advice useless. There should now\n\tbe an opportunity for a relatively graceful exit.  \n\n    o\tpolyroot() misbehaved if all coefficients except that of the highest\n\tdegree term were zero (partial fix for PR#751)\n\n    o\tspline(method=&quot;natural&quot;) was extrapolating incorrectly (both\n\tto the left and to the right, for different reasons).  (PR#653)\n\n    o\tLine clipping was incorrect for log-plots. (PR#839)\n\n    o\tAdd explicit test for rank-deficient residuals to summary.manova().\n\n    o\tThe help search databases did not contain the data from the\n\tplatform-specific help files.\n\n    o\tparse.dcf() and hence package.contents() now work with a warning\n\tfor empty contents' files.\n\n    o\twhich.min() and which.max() now properly work for 0-length and\n\tNA-only arguments.\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This means that readLines() can be used on DOS\n\tfiles and source() on Mac files, for example.\n\n\tAlso, CRLF-terminated files can be used as stdin on Unix, and\n\tfiles with last lines without an EOL mark can be used as stdin\n\tand source()-ed on Unix and Windows.\n\n    o\tDESCRIPTION file has a new recommended `Maintainer:' field.\n\n    o\tstars() now uses a larger &quot;cex&quot; for the labels, and cex and lwd\n\tare now arguments. Further, the argument names (xlim, ylim,\n\taxes) are now consistent with other plot functions.  The key symbol\n\tis not clipped anymore into the plot region by default.\n\n    o\tDate-time quantities are now printed with the timezone, if known.\n\n    o\tR CMD build now ignores all files specified (via Perl regexps)\n\tin file `.Rbuildignore' in the top-level source\tdirectory of a\n\tpackage.\n\n    o\tHorizontal boxplots are possible with  horizontal = TRUE.\n\n    o\tall.equal() on lists now compares them as generic vectors, that\n\tis they are equal if have identical names attributes and\n\tall components are equal.\n\n    o\tInvalid lines in .Renviron now give warnings when R is started.\n\n    o\tArgument `na.last' implemented for rank().\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   There have been many small improvements/corrections in the\n\tdocumentation. In particular:\n\n\tThe help pages for lm and glm now describe the fitted objects.\n\n\tis.vector() is now correctly documented: complex vectors and\n\tlists return TRUE.\n\n    o   The default sortedXyData constructor in the nls package now\n        handles missing values in the response.\n\n    o\tOn startup, file .RData is now restored *after* the site and\n\tuser profiles are loaded (if at all).  This is as previously\n\tdocumented.\n\n    o\tas.POSIXlt (and *ct) operating on a character string\n\tonly extracted the date (and not the time) in some cases.\n\n    o\tas.POSIXct() on character objects was ignoring `tz'.\n\n    o\tcodoc(ignore.generic.functions = TRUE) works again.\n\n    o\tExplicitly close files opened by sink() for OSes (such as\n\tWindows) that benefit from it.\n\n    o\tPrevent closing the sink connection (which would be a silly\n\tthing to do).\n\n    o\tshowConnections(all = TRUE) was sometimes counting connections\n\tincorrectly, and so not showing some closed ones.\n\n    o\tts(1:10, start= c(1999,6), end = c(2000,3), frequency = 12)\n\tnow prints both years (as it should).\n\n    o\tMonthly multivariate time series now print proper month names\n\tin all cases.\n\n    o\tprint.stl(), print.princomp() and print.prcomp() now pass on\n\t`digits =' etc.\n\n    o\tprompt() now produces a \\usage{} line for data frames and\n\tother datasets, as documented in `Writing R Extensions'.\n\n    o\tglm() now returns correct linear predictor and fitted values\n\tfor zero-weight cases.\n\n    o\tscan(strip.white=TRUE) and readline() could give incorrect\n\tanswers when an input field was empty or blank.\n\n    o\tdchisq() now behaves better for large values of its ncp parameter.\n\n    o\tbesselJ(*, nu) is now ok for nu &lt; 1; fix improves accuracy of\n\tother values by a few bits as well.\n\n    o\tThe convergence criterion in the Fortran SVD code has been\n\tchanged to circumvent spurious convergence errors when\n\tcomparing extended-precision quantities on ix86 Linux (and\n\tsome compilers and options).\n\n    o\tRdindex now handles multi-line \\title{}'s correctly.\n\n    o\tAdd weights.glm() so that plot.lm() gets the correct weights from\n\tglm objects (the ones that go with deviance residuals not the\n\tworking residuals).\n\n    o\tPrinting a language object (e.g. a formula) in a list was\n\tclobbering the buffer holding the tag labels which then were\n\tlost in subsequent lines of printout (PR#746).\n\n    o\taic in family() objects is now computed more precisely using\n\tdxxxx(log=TRUE).  For binomial fits the value was wrong for\n\tmodels specified via proportions and weights (PR#796).\n\n\tAvoid NaN values in aic where n = 0 occurs.\n\n    o\tUsing non-integer numbers of successes in a binomial glm (as\n\tformerly in demo(lm.glm)) now gives a warning, as the theory and\n\tin particular the AIC value is not applicable.\n\n    o\tdemo(is.things) works again {is.ALL() doesn't call methods\n\tanymore}.\n\n    o\tpersp(*, nticks = nn) now works (better) for too small nn.\n\tpersp(*, main = t1, sub= t2) now work (as always documented).\n\n    o\tPrinting of attributes of a list element no longer precedes\n\t`attr' by the tag (PR#715).\n\n    o\tIt is no longer possible to use df[foo] to select non-existent\n\tcolumns in df and so create an invalid object of class\n\t&quot;data.frame&quot; (PR#698).\n\n    o\tedit.data.frame() was trying to set row.names on a list, which\n\tis no longer allowed.\n\n    o\tIn the \\link[pkg]{topic}, `pkg' was not being used if `topic'\n\twas found in a package in .lib.loc.  Now `pkg' is always used.\n\n    o\tplot() with small relative ranges gave an error, which e.g. broke\n\tlibrary(ts); plot(stl(ts(rep(1:7, 15), freq = 7), s.win = &quot;per&quot;))\n\n    o\tUsing scan() with a 0-length `what' argument now gives an error\n\tmessage rather than a segfault.\n\n    o\tLoading .Random.seed could extremely rarely and with some\n\tgenerators reject a value as NA_INTEGER when it was valid.\n\n    o   save(..., ascii=TRUE) created broken files when saving strings\n        containing special characters (ASCII code &gt; 127).\n\n    o\tmean(c(1,NA,NA,NA)[-1], trim = .1, na.rm = TRUE) doesn't give an\n\terror anymore.\n\n    o\tAs the supplied afm files are not properly in the ISOLatin1\n\tencoding, the font metric for &quot;-&quot; was wrong since 0.63 on a\n\tpostscript/xfig device, and randomly wrong in 1.2.0.  It will\n\tnow be correct (but the files remain incorrect: C45 is &quot;minus&quot;\n\tnot &quot;hyphen&quot; and there are missing slots).\n\n\tMetrics for the duplicated characters (acute, dieresis,\n\tmacron, space) in ISOLatin1 encoding are now correct for both\n\toccurrences: previously only one was present.\n\n    o\tThe data-time functions try harder to guess the DST setting\n\twhen the OS does not know, as some OSes were printing times\n\tin DST if this was marked as unknown.\n\n    o\tSetting par(pty=) after par(pin=) or par(plt=) was having no\n\teffect until the margins were set.\n\n    o\tNested \\describe sections in .Rd files have (again) nested\n\tindentation when converted to text.\n\n    o\tConcatenation of C strings by ## is no longer used, to avoid\n\tspurious warnings from some recent versions of gcc.\n\n    o\tdev.copy2eps() allows a `paper' argument to be passed to\n\tpostscript().\n\n    o\tfile.show() handles the case of zero files better.\n\n    o\tformula.lm uses object$formula if it exists, in preference \n\tto object$terms.\n\n    o\tstrsplit() is corrected for an empty split pattern.\n\n    o\tkronecker() now does a better job when creating dimnames.\n\n    o\tBetter handling of input dimnames in fourfoldplot().\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

This improves performance, sometimes\n\tmarginally but sometimes by double or more.  The workspace is\n\tno longer statically sized and both the vector heap and the\n\tnumber of nodes can grow as needed.  (They can shrink again,\n\tbut never below the initially allocated sizes.)\t See ?Memory\n\tfor a longer description, including the new command-line\n\toptions to manage the settings.\n\n    o\tvalues of `--min-nsize' up to 50M (2Gb on 64-bit Solaris) are\n\tallowed.\n\n    o\tA (preliminary) version of S4-like connections has been added,\n\tand most functions which take a &quot;file&quot; argument can now work\n\twith a connection as well as a file name.  For more details,\n\tsee the chapter on Connections in the R Data Import/Export\n\tmanual.\n\n    o\tNew command-line option `--no-restore-history' implied by\n\t`--vanilla'.\n\n    o\tCommand-line option `--no-restore' is now `--no-restore-data'\n\tand `--no-restore' implies `--no-restore-*' (currently `data'\n\tand `history').\n\n    o\tThe more recent GNU regex from grep-2.4.2 is used.  This uses\n\tlocale-based ordering for ranges on platforms with strcoll.\n\n    o\tThe print routines now escape &quot; (as \\&quot;) in a character string\n\tonly when it is printed as a quoted string.  This makes\n\tprint(, quote=FALSE) and cat() consistent.\n\n\n    o\tThe standard methods for add1() and drop1() now attempt to cope\n\twith missing values by using a subset of the data that is\n\t`cleaned' by na.action for the maximal model under consideration.\n\n    o\tanova() for 3 or more lm objects now behaves compatibly\twith S\n\tand anova.glmlist().  The old behaviour is still available by\n\tcalling anovalist.lm() directly.\n\n    o\tanova() for multiple lm and glm objects no longer truncates the\n\tformula printed. There is much more extensive documentation \n\tfor anova() methods.\n\n    o\tNew method as.data.frame.table() for converting the array-based\n\trepresentation of a contingency table to a data frame containing\n\tthe classifying factors and the corresponding counts.\n\n    o\tNew function assocplot() for producing Cohen-Friendly\n\tassociation plots.\n\n    o\tautoload() accepts lib.loc and other arguments to library()\n\n    o\tbxp() has new argument `frame.plot', as plot.default().\n\n    o\tcontour() now has `axes' and `frame.plot' args.\n\n    o\tcontrasts(, FALSE) now always returns an identity matrix,\n\tto make model.matrix compatible with S. This affects models\n\tsuch as lm(y ~ o - 1) where o is an ordered factor.\n\n    o\t`where' command added to debug().\n\n    o\tdemo(dynload) (which used the superseded call_R interface)\n\thas been removed.\n\n    o\tClass &quot;dendrogram&quot; in package mva providing general support\n\tfor tree-like structures (plotting, cutting, ...).\n\n    o\tdev.copy2eps() and dev2bitmap() preserve the aspect ratio of the\n\tcopied device if just one of `width' and `height' is specified.\n\n    o\tdump() has new argument append, argument `fileout' has been\n\trenamed to `file' (for consistency with all other functions).\n\n    o\tedit.default() now checks for an unset `editor' argument, and\n\tterminates with an error if the editor cannot be run.\n\n    o\tThe `mode' argument of exists() and get() is interpreted\n\tas mode(x) rather than typeof(x), following S.\n\n    o\tNew functions file.access() and file.info() for information on\n\tfiles on the user's file systems.\n\n    o\tNew convenience function file.copy().\n\n    o\tfile.show() allows `pager' argument to be an R function, and\n\tconsequently, the `pager' option can be an R function. \n\n    o\tFormatting (and printing) of data.frames with complex objects is\n\timproved.  toString was added as a new function.\n\n    o\tformat() has a new argument `justify' controlling the\n\tjustification of character strings (and factors).\n\n    o\tFormula objects now have an environment and code manipulating\n\tthem needs to take care to preserve it or set an appropriate\n\tenvironment.\n\n    o\tNew function fourfoldplot() for producing fourfold displays of\n\t2 by 2 by k contingency tables.\n\n    o\tgc() now reports the space allocated, not the space free,\n\tsince the total space is now variable.\n\n    o\tNew primitive gc.time() to report on time spent in garbage\n\tcollection.\n\n    o\thclust() takes new argument `members' allowing dissimilarity\n\tmatrices both for singletons (as until now) and clusters.\n\n    o\thelp() has an additional `pager' argument which may be passed to\n\tfile.show()  {useful for ESS fans}.\n\n    o\tThere is now an R `Hershey' list object for Hershey vector font\n\tcomputations and documentation.\n\n    o\thist() now returns a &quot;histogram&quot; object and calls the new\n\tfunction plot.histogram() for plotting.\n\tIt now also allows character labels.\n\n    o\tif(*) now gives a more intelligible error message\n\twhen &quot;*&quot; cannot be coerced to logical.\n\n    o\tinherits() is now an internal function and compatible with S.\n\n    o\tNew function lag.plot() in package ts.\n\n    o\tlegend() has a new argument pt.bg.\n\n    o\tThe commands history can be loaded with loadhistory(), saved\n\twith savehistory() and displayed with history(), under Windows\n\tand under Unix using the readline or GNOME interfaces.\n\n    o\tmad() has new (logical) arguments &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; (the first \n\tgiving S compatibility).\n\t\n    o\tNew function manova() and summary method.\n\n    o\tFunction mantelhaen.test() in package ctest now can deal with\n\tgeneral I x J x K tables.  In addition, in the 2 x 2 x K case,\n\tit can also perform an exact conditional test of independence,\n\tand gives confidence intervals for the common odds ratio.\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() now uses the environment of its formula argument,\n\trather than the parent environment, to evaluate variables not\n\tfound in the data argument. See help(formula).\n\n    o\tmosaicplot() can now also create extended mosaic plots, which\n\tvisualize the residuals from a log-linear model using color and\n\toutline.\n\n    o\tNew utility function n2mfrow().\n\n    o\tnlm(check.analyticals = TRUE) now warns if the supplied\n\tgradient and/or hessian are of the wrong length.\n     \n    o\tNew function object.size() to give approximate memory allocation.\n\n    o\toptim() now checks the length of an analytical gradient at\n\teach evaluation.\n\n    o\tThe L-BFGS-B method of optim() now support tracing, at several\n\tlevels of detail.\n\n     o\toptions(check.bounds = TRUE)  makes each vector extension\n\tby sub-assignment (&quot;x[.] &lt;- .&quot;) produce a warning.\n\n   o\toptions(width) now admits to a limit (previously 200, now\n\t10000) and gives a more informative message if out of range\n\t(as it does now for digits and expressions).\n\n    o\tFunction path.expand() to do tilde-expansion on file paths.\n\tThis provides an interface to R_ExpandFileName, which is now\n\ta documented entry point.\n\n    o\t.Platform has new component &quot;endian&quot;, useful for binary file\n\tmanipulations.\n\n    o\tplot.function() and curve() now take xlim as default for (from,to)\n\tif the former is specified.\n\n    o\tplot.hclust() allows arguments main, sub, etc, and has non-empty\n\tdefaults for these.\n\n    o\tplot.ts(x,y) now allows to suppress labels and lines; \n\tit is better documented.\n\n    o\tThe postscript() driver now allows a user-specified family so,\n\tfor example, one can use the same fonts in diagrams as in \n\trunning text.\n\n    o\tThe postscript() driver allows its prolog to be changed (by an\n\texpert) via object .ps.prolog.\n\n    o\tprop.table() and margin.table() now work with an empty `margin'.\n\n    o\tFormerly deprecated function provide() is now defunct.\n\n    o\tNew functions read.delim() and read.delim2() to make it\n\teasier to read delimited files as Windows programs tend to\n\tcreate (usually TAB separated).\n\n    o\tNew readLines() function to read a file line-by-line.\n\n    o\tNew functions reshapeLong() and reshapeWide() emulating Stata's\n        reshape command. These are still labeled experimental and\n        might be improved (or removed) in later versions.\n\n    o\trow.names() and row.names&lt;-() are now generic functions which\n\tcall rownames() as their default method and have methods for\n\tclass &quot;data.frame&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew function Rprof() for profiling R expressions under Unix.\n\tConfigure with `--enable-R-profiling' (on by default) to make\n\tthis operational.\n\n    o\tsave(, oldstyle=TRUE) has been withdrawn.\n\n    o\tscan() and read.table() have a new argument `fill' which can\n\tbe set TRUE to allow reading files with unequal number of\n\tfields per line. (Programs like Excel have a habit of creating\n\tsuch files when exporting.)\n\n    o\tscan() and read.table() have a new argument `blank.lines.skip'\n\tto allow blank lines to be read.\n\n    o\tscan() now reads empty character fields as &quot;&quot; not &quot;NA&quot; unless\n\t&quot;&quot; is included in na.strings.\n\n    o\tsmooth() in package eda has a better default (3RS3R instead of\n\t3RSR) and more arguments, e.g. `twiceit' for some S\n\tcompatibility and kind = &quot;3R&quot; for running medians of 3.\n\n    o\tstrsplit() has a new argument `extended' controlling whether to\n\tuse extended (the default) or basic regular expressions for\n\tsplitting.\n\t\n    o\tSys.getenv() becomes the preferred name for getenv(), which is\n\tnow deprecated.\n\n    o\tNew functions Sys.getlocale() and Sys.setlocale() to query and\n\tset aspects of the locale of the R process, and\n\tSys.localeconv() to find the default decimal point, etc.\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.info() for platform, host and user information.\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.putenv() to set environment variables.\n\n    o\tNew function Sys.sleep() to suspend execution for a while.\n\n    o\tDate-time support functions with classes &quot;POSIXct&quot; and\n\t&quot;POSIXlt&quot; to represent dates/times (resolution 1 second) in\n\tthe POSIX formats.  Functions include Sys.time(), as.POSIXct(),\n\tstrftime(), strptime(),\t and methods for format, plot, c, ....\n\tThere are conversion functions for objects from packages\n\t`date' and `chron'; unlike those packages these support\n\tfunctions know about time zones (if the OS does).\n\n    o\ttcltk library now has tkpager() which is designed to be used\n\tby file.show() and shows help pages etc. in separate text\n\twidgets. \n\n    o\ttcltk is now more careful about removing the objects\n\trepresenting widgets in the R workspace when the windows are\n\tdestroyed (e.g. using window manager controls)\t\n\n    o\ttcltk library has had several canvas functions implemented.\n    \n    o\ttcltk now wraps callbacks to R in a try() construct - the\n\tnonlocal return from R's error handling could bring the Tk\n\tsystem into a strange state.  \n\n    o\tNew demos for tcltk: tkfaq, tkfilefind, tkcanvas. \n\n    o\ttermplot() now has an `ask' argument.\n\n    o\tterms() creates objects which now inherit from class &quot;formula&quot;,\n\tso for example as.formula(terms.object) needs to replaced by \n\tformula(terms.object).\n\n    o\ttraceback() is now printed un-quoted and labelled by the\n\tframe number.\n\n    o\tNew argument `recursive' to unlink(). The default behaviour on\n\tUnix is now that of rm -f, not rm -rf.\tunlink() is now\n\tcompatible across platforms.\n\n    o\tNew functions write.ftable() and read.ftable() for writing out\n\tand reading in flat contingency tables.\n\n    o\twrite.table() now quotes factor columns if quote=TRUE, and has\n\ta new argument `qmethod' to control the escaping of\n\tembedded quotes in character or factor columns.\n\n    o\tNew function xtabs() providing a formula interface to cross\n\ttabulation.\n\n\n    o\tThe R Data Import/Export Manual (`R-data.texi') has been added.\n\n    o\tThe set of valid R names is now described (at last) in R-intro.\n\n    o\tThe R Language Manual (`R-lang.texi') is now included and built\n\tin the same way as the other manuals.\n\n    o   The R manuals (R-intro, R-exts, ...) are converted to HTML\n        format (if the necessary texinfo tools are available) and\n\tlinked into the top HTML help page.\n\n    o\tThe header file `R.h' and those included from it are now usable\n\twith C++ code.\n\n    o\tNew header file `R_ext/Boolean.h': Rboolean type with TRUE and\n\tFALSE enum constants.\n\n    o\tNew header file `Rgraphics.h' to allow addons to use graphics\n\tstructures.\n\n    o\tRecommended include file `Rmath.h' replaces `R_ext/Mathlib.h'.\n\n    o\tBessel, beta and gamma functions are now documented as part of\n\tthe API.  Undocumented entry points are no longer in the\n\theader files, and some are no longer visible.\n\n    o\tCalloc &amp; Realloc failures now give size information.\n\n    o\tDESCRIPTION file in installed packages has a new `Built:' field\n\tgiving build information (R version, platform, date).\n\n    o\tMuch improved support for C++ code in add-on packages under Unix.\n\tNew configure/build variables SHLIB_CXXLD and SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS\n\tfor specifying the command and flags needed for building shared\n\tlibraries containing objects from a C++ compiler.\n\tConfigure tries to get these right in typical cases (GNU tools\n\tand/or common platforms).\n\tC++ source suffixes `.cpp' and `.C' are now recognized in\n\taddition to `.cc'.\n\n    o\tConfigure/build variables MAINLD and MAINLDFLAGS are renamed to\n\tMAIN_LD and MAIN_LDFLAGS for consistency with other MAIN_* vars,\n\tsimilarly for SHLIBLD and SHLIBLDFLAGS.\n\n    o\tConfigure/build variable FLIBS now only contains the Fortran 77\n\tintrinsic and run-time libraries needed for linking a Fortran 77\n\tprogram or shared library (as determined by configure).\t BLAS\n\tlibrary detection was extended, with results saved to the Make\n\tvariable BLAS_LIBS which is also available to add-on packages.\n\n    o\tR CMD build and check have been completely re-written in Perl.\n\tIn addition to running examples, check now also checks the\n\tdirectory structure and control files, makes a temporary\n\tinstallation and runs LaTeX on the help pages.\tBuild has been\n\treduced to cleaning, rewriting indices and creating tar files.\n\n\tThe same files of Perl code are now also used under Windows.\n\n    o\tAdd-ons for utilities like Perl or LaTeX have now a central\n\tplace in $R_HOME/share. Migration of existing files might take\n\ta while, though.\n\n    o\tPreliminary support for building R as a shared library (`libR')\n\tunder Unix.  Use configure with option `--enable-R-shlib' or do\n\t`make libR' in directory `src/main' to create the shared\n\tlibrary.\n\t\n\tThere is also a linker front-end `R CMD LINK' which is useful\n\tfor creating executable programs linked against the R shared\n\tlibrary.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tNew &quot;[.AsIs&quot; function fixing PR#665.\n\n    o\tEffectively zero-length arrows() are omitted (rather than getting\n\ta system- and device-dependent arbitrary angle).\n\n    o\tbarplot() passes &quot;...&quot; down to plot.window as documented.\n\n    o\tbxp(*) now obeys axes, xaxt, yaxt &amp; ylim arguments (again?).\n\n    o\tcontour(.., labcex = 0.6, .. , vfont = c(&quot;sans serif&quot;, &quot;plain&quot;), ..)\n\tnow behaves as it has been documented, PR#740.\n\n    o\tD(.) is now more correctly documented, has second argument\n\t&quot;name&quot; instead of &quot;namevec&quot; (S compatibility), and gives a warning\n\twhen name has not length 1.\n\n    o\tdbinom() and dpois() now use a the accurate algorithm of C.Loader;\n\te.g., 1 - 2*sum(dbinom(0:999, 1999, 1/2)) is now zero instead of 1e-12.\n\n    o\tdbeta(), df(), dt(), dnbinom(), dgeom(), dgamma(),\n\tnow all use the more accurate algorithms of dbinom() and dpois();\n\tMore limits are computed correctly, e.g. dgeom(Inf,*), or\n\tdnbinom(*,*,p=0), and integer argument coercion is more consistent.\n\t\n    o\tdbeta(x, a,b) was giving NaN and Inf for large a and b.\n\n    o\tThe math functions now (again!) return NaN (not NA)\n\twhen the warning message says so (e.g. gamma(-1)).\n\n    o\tPaper sizes for &quot;a4&quot; and &quot;legal&quot; were interchanged in dev.print().\n\n    o\tImproved logic in the re-scaling of plots in dev.print().\n\n    o\tdev.print() and dev.copy2eps() now evaluate arguments as\n\tneeded, so e.g. dev.print(file=&quot;junk.ps&quot;, horizontal=F) will\n\twork (previously =FALSE was needed).\n\n    o\tNow dweibull(0,1) == dexp(0) == 1 for consistency.\n\n    o\tChanging column modes from factor/character to numeric in\n\tedit.data.frame() (and fix() on data frames) is now allowed.\n\n    o\tgctorture() did return a value although documented not to, that of\n\tgcinfo.\t It now returns the previous setting of gctorture.\n\n    o\tglm() now follows lm() in dropping unused factor levels when fitting.\n\n    o   hist() now labels y-axis Density rather than Relative Frequency\n        if freq=FALSE. The `intensities' component of the result is\n\tnow deprecated and `density' should be used instead. \n\n    o\thsv() truncation bug fixed (hopefully correctly this time...)\n\n    o\tlibrary.dynam() no longer fails if the library appears more than\n\tonce in lib.loc.\n\n    o\tlm.fit &amp; lm.wfit (and hence lm) now give understandable error\n\tmessages when there are 0 non-NA cases.\n\n    o\tmatch() does not always use &quot;as.character()&quot; anymore, fixes PR#741.\n\n    o\tTrimmed mean() and median() are no longer attempted for complex\n\tdata.\n\n    o\tmedian() of empty vector is now NA.\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix() can now handle NAs in factors.\n\n    o\tmodel.matrix() now uses &quot;:&quot; not &quot;.&quot; in labelling interaction\n\tterms, as terms() and the prototype do (PR#701).\n\n    o\told.packages() now sorts version strings correctly by\n\tsplitting at &quot;.&quot; and &quot;-&quot;.\n\n    o\toptim() has several new precautions against bugs, one of which was\n\tan infinite loop in the L-BFGS-B method if the derivatives\n\twere inaccurate (or if numerical derivatives were used and the\n\tproblem was badly scaled).\n\n    o\tpairs() now obeys an &quot;cex = &quot; argument, and so does panel.smooth().\n\n    o   pf() had a bug in the code handling large noncentrality\n        parameters, going all the way back to the original Appl.Stat.\n\talgorithm (PR#752). This affected pbeta() as well.\n\n    o\tphantom(expr) in plotmath was used to calculate the bounding\n\tboxes, but the space was not actually used in typesetting the \n\texpression (PR#622).\n\n    o   Problem with subsetting and &quot;...&quot; arguments in plot.formula()\n        (PR#757)\n\n    o\tplot.lm() has a better default for its `ask' argument.\n\n    o\tplot.new() does *NOT* allow an argument (`ask') anymore.\n\tThis has not been working (since ~ R 0.49), is low-level and\n\thence should not break anything.\n\n    o\tplot.stl() now uses correct time labels for tickmarks of x-axes.\n\n    o\tpnorm() is somewhat more accurate (SIXTEN=16; PR#699) and\n\t`infinitesimally faster' in some cases, thanks to James M. Rath.\n\n    o\tFailure to open a postscript() device now gives diagnostic warnings.\n\n    o\tZero the widths of undefined chars in postscript().\n\n    o\tMake font metrics local to the device in postscript(), so\n\tthat simultaneous instances of postscript/xfig/bitmap can use\n\tdifferent values for `family'.\n\n    o\tpostscript() no longer uses the initclip operator, which\n\twas against the EPSF specifications and broke inclusion of\n\tgraphics in some documents.\n\n    o\tIn postscript(), cleaned up the internals to fix some\n\tcases where it was unclear whether a variable was meant to set\n\tor track device status.\n\n    o\tIn some cases, emitted postscript violated the PS Document\n\tStructuring Conventions since some settings were carried over from\n\tone page to the next. (Caused breakage when turning\n\tantialiasing on/off in &quot;gv&quot; for instance.)\n\n    o\tThe DocumentMedia comment in postscript() output was wrong,\n\tand the font DSC comments have been changed to the preferred\n\tstyle for DSC 3.0.\n\n    o\tpretty(x &lt;- c(2.8,3))[1] - x[1] is now 0; in general,\n\tp &lt;- pretty(x) now again fulfills  p[1] &lt;= x[] &lt;= p[length(p)].\n\n    o\tprint.dist() {mva} now passes &quot;...&quot; to print.default.\n\n    o\tprint.noquote(&quot;ABC&quot;) now works.\n\n    o\tprompt(fn) uses fn's &quot;source&quot; attribute if it has one.\n\n    o\tIn prop.test(), the conf.int. now contains the estimate,\n\teven when that is 0 or 1 (PR#714).\n\n    o\tqnorm(0) and qnorm(1) now give -/+ Inf (again!).\n\n    o\tqt(*, log = TRUE) has a somewhat extended working range.\n\n    o\tSpecifying col.names in read.table() now overrides any header\n\tline in the data file.\n\n    o\tBug caused rpois() to generate biased variables in some cases.\n\n    o\tscale(scale=TRUE) gave all NAs in any columns containing NAs.\n\n    o\teda's smooth() now computes Tukey's endrule properly.\n\n    o\tsmooth.spline()'s GCV method now uses a more accurate formula\n\twhen there are repeated x points.\n\n    o\tstars() fix (for 0/NA columns) PR#739.\n\t\n    o\tdata(state)'s  state.abb  has been corrected to use official\n\t2-letter abbrevations.\n\n    o\tstrsplit() had two memory leaks.\n\n    o\ttcltk interface now has better string quoting and no longer breaks on\n\tstrings with unbalanced braces\n\n    o\ttcltk callbacks used to include a &quot;%...&quot; argument on the call if the\n\tcallback function had a &quot;...&quot; argument. This is no longer the case.\n\n    o\tt.test() allows an input vector of length 2.\n\n    o\tMethod dispatch in primitive functions such as `c' only\n\toccurred if they were called by that name, and in particular\n\tnot if used in lapply or called as .Primitive(&quot;c&quot;).  It now\n\talways occurs.\n\n    o\tMethod dispatching now forces evaluation of promises, so\n\tautoloading works with methods.\n\n    o\tc(0.099999994, 0.2) prints as 0.1 0.2 not 0.10 0.20 after\n\tcorrecting the precision calculations.\n\n    o\tInternal function fprec was overflowing for numbers around\n\t1e-305.\n\n    o\t[internal] .C(&quot;strsignif&quot;,*) doesn't use fixed size strings anymore\n\t(possible overflow).\n\n    o\tff[i] &lt;- r  now works for formula (and potentially other\n\tnon-standard) objects ff.\n\n    o\tErrors in argument matching could cause crashes if error\n\thandler was used.\n\n    o\tNULL == ... now gives logical(0) instead of an error.\n\tThis fixes a bug with e.g. apply(X,2,median, na.rm = TRUE) and\n\tall(NULL == NULL) is now TRUE.\n\n    o\tpolylines with more than 64K pieces will now work on more X\n\tservers with the x11 device.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rd2dvi now again works with file names containing &quot;_&quot; or &quot;$&quot;.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rdconv now handles .rd as input file extension correctly\n        in all cases.\n\n    o\tmake install could fail if there were no shared libraries to\n\tinstall (e.g. on vanilla Solaris).\n\n    o\tRd's \\describe{} constructs are converted better to text\n\toutput, and \\items of &gt;=22 chars now work.\n\n    o\tHelp aliases &quot;(&quot; and &quot;{&quot; now work, apart from as PDF hyperlinks.\n\n    o\tNA || x , NA &amp;&amp; y (etc) do not give errors anymore, but work as\n\tthe &quot;|&quot; and &quot;&amp;&quot; operators and as documented (PR#749).\n\n    o   Coercing lists to functions failed if argument list was empty.\n        (PR#743). Also coercing functions to lists was wrong when the\n\tbody was a single constant.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

One can either\n\tset configure variables TCLTK_CPPFLAGS and TCLTK_LIBS, or give\n\tthe locations of the tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh scripts via\n\tthe `--with-tcl-config' and `--with-tk-config' arguments.\n\n    o   prop.trend.test() - test for trend in proportions.\n\n    o   write.table() has new argument `dec' for setting the decimal\n        separator (SPSS/Windows and probably others want commas in\n\tcontinental European locales).\n\n    o   Advance warning: save(, oldstyle=TRUE) will no longer be\n\tavailable after this release.\n\n    o   Symbols can now be coerced to expressions, making\n\tas.expression(quote(a)) work\n        \n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tdata() now works correctly with data-only packages.\n\n    o\tStandalone Mathlib can now be made if builddir = srcdir\n\t(working around an undocumented autoconf `feature').\n\n    o\tCheck for pre-1.1.0 saved object .Postscript.options in postscript().\n\n    o\tMore stringent checks on the arguments to dataentry().\n\n    o   Specifying xlab as an expression now works again.\n\n    o   dev2bitmap() works again.\n\n    o   Numerous uses of `F' and `T' replaced by `FALSE' and `TRUE'.\n\n    o\tbxp() now extends `ylim' properly when notch=TRUE (and a\n\tnotch is more extreme than other stats).\n\tAlso, varwidth is okay again, see example(split).\n\n    o   Making manuals without making R first now works.\n\n    o\tprincomp() now works when some eigenvalues are tiny negative\n\tvalues (which are treated as zero).\n\n    o   SearchEngine.html was not installed when builddir != srcdir.\n\n    o\tlm.{w}fit(x,y,..) now work when x has no column names.\n\tThese functions no longer add and subtract n zeros when there's no\n\toffset.  They are now documented somewhat.\n\n    o   Some HTML files used src=&quot;R.css&quot; instead of href=&quot;R.css&quot;\n        causing some browsers to ignore the style sheet. R.css now\n\tpasses the w3c CSS validator and gives the intended results\n\twith Internet Explorer. R.css is copied to all library directories.\n\n    o\tThe data editor no longer crashes when entries contain more than\n\t45 characters, and works correctly if the field width is\n\tlarger than the window width.\n\n    o\tRecording plots used to ignore graphics events before the last\n\treplay.\n\n    o\tplot(), points(), etc now give warnings and error for invalid\n\t`type' arguments.\n\n    o\tmatplot() now allows the same `type's as plot().\n\n    o\tdev.print() and dev.copy2eps() now work when called from a\n\tfunction, such as dev2bitmap().\n\n    o\tanova.glmlist works correctly with decreasing models and\n\ttest=&quot;F&quot; now gets the correct residual df.\n\n    o\tFunctions created (not just edited) with fix() now get\n\tenvironment .GlobalEnv not the body of fix.\n\n    o\tRdconv was ignoring OS-specific parts of the files with some\n\tPerl versions. (This did not affect installing packages.)\n\n    o\tR CMD check  did not run more than one specific test.\n\n    o\tkeyword2html omitted items when changing up a level, so\n\tthe HTML search engine keyword list was missing `data' and\n\t`utilities', for example.\n\n    o\taov() with multiple strata was setting some spurious options.\n\n    o\tUnder UNIX, help(, htmlhelp=TRUE) uses the linked copy of the\n\tHTML file in ~/.R if help.start() has been run recently in the\n\tsession, so the style sheet and hyperlinks should now be found.\n\n    o\tdotplot's arguments `color' and `lcolor' are now interpreted\n\tcorrectly if they are vectors of length &gt; 1.  (It is not clear\n\tfrom the help that this was ever intended.)\n\n    o\tError messages of e.g. do.call() are now spaced properly.\n\n    o\tsummary(.matrix | .data.frame) now respects a `digits' argument.\n\n    o   scan() recognises quoted strings by default again. The default\n\tfor the quote= argument got set wrongly when it was\n\tintroduced. They are, however, turned off when using sep=&quot;\\n&quot;,\n\tsince you probably want unprocessed lines of text in that\n\tcase.\n\n    o   fixed buglet where scan() would double a character following a\n        terminating quote symbol.\n\n    o\tkmeans was failing on vector inputs (although not documented\n\tto accept such).\n\n    o   fixes in predict.lm (John Maindonald)\n\n    o   NCOL got confused by 1D arrays, which it now reports have 1\n\tcolumn rather than NA.\n\n    o   rep(1:2,c(1,-1)) segfaulted (PR 619)\n\n    o   x[[&quot;a&quot;]] &lt;- y rejected some object types for y (e.g.\n        expressions) which were accepted in x$a &lt;- y (PR\n\n    o   data editor froze on empty data frame, and more generally on\n\tzero-length cols.\n\n    o   data editor did not handle factors properly in numeric-edit\n        mode.\n\n    o   table() misbehaved on empty (or all-NA) data\n\n    o   data editor now handles empty data frames, allowing data entry\n        to begin with  dd&lt;-edit(data.frame())  or\n\tdd&lt;-data.frame() ; fix(dd)\n\n    o   plotting math expressions when specified as a LANGSXP or\n        SYMSXP didn't work in several cases: plot(1,main=quote(a))\n        would segfault and there were problems with title(), text(),\n        and mtext() as well.\n\n    o\toptim(): no more segfault for REPORT=0; corrected error msg; ..\n\tmaxit default is now okay also when &quot;L-*-B&quot; is chosen automatically.\n        Using (abs|rel)tol with that method now gives a warning.\n\n    o\ttext() did not respect its `xpd' argument, the default of which\n        is still to use par(&quot;xpd&quot;); gave a wrong error message in one case.\n\n    o\tpolygon() had an incorrect documentation and silently disregarded\n\t&quot;...&quot; arguments.\n\n    o\tpredict.loess was giving incorrect results (those for the\n\tnon-robust fit) in the case of a fit with family = &quot;symmetric&quot;\n\tand surface = &quot;direct&quot; and prediction with se = FALSE.  The\n\tfitted values were missing for such fits.\n\n    o\tBetter rendering of ^ and ~ in latex in \\code{} (and they should\n\tnot appear outside code and verbatim sections).\n\n    o   Fixed unterminated string problem with lty (PR 584)\n\n    o   Fixed scoping problem with quasi() family (PR 614)\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

Please read config.site and\n\tINSTALL if you have set flags for previous versions.\n\n    o\tNew package tcltk, providing interface and language bindings for\n\tthe Tcl/Tk graphical interface toolkit. This makes it possible\n\tto do some rather nifty things with buttons and entry fields\n\tand so forth in very few lines of code.  It is still somewhat\n\texperimental so don't go churning out thousands of lines of\n\tGUI code and then blame us for changing the API later on. It does\n\tnot currently work with GNOME because of event loop differences.\n\tSee demo(tkttest) and demo(tkdensity). \n\n    o\tInternally using global R_Expressions [getOption(&quot;expressions&quot;)]\n\tdramatically speeds up eval.c.\n\n    o\tThe X11 support code is now in a separate shared library, and\n\tflag --gui=none will run R without X11 support (and so x11()\n\tand data.entry() will not be available).  R BATCH sets --gui=none.\n\n    o\tConfiguring without X (e.g. --without-x) does work (at last).\n\tconfigure will report if X11 support has been included.\n\tIf R has been built without X11 the default GUI is &quot;none&quot;.\n\n    o\tGNOME support files have moved from src/gnome to src/unix/gnome\n\tand the code is now in a separate shared library.  Both\n\t--gui=GNOME and --gui=gnome are allowed.\n\n\tThe main graphics device for use with GNOME is now called\n\tgtk(); the x11() device from the X11 support can also be used.\n\t(The gnome() device remains unreliable, and is by default\n\tunavailable.)\n\n\tAll GNOME support now installs in R_HOME/gnome to make it\n\teasier to package separately.\n\n    o\tCommand line option `-g' can now be used as short version of\n\t`--gui'.\n\n    o\tThe &quot;keep.source&quot; option now defaults to interactive()\n\tinstead of TRUE.\n\n    o\tMany interface enhancements to the data editor, which now uses\n\t(by default) variable-width columns and much less redrawing.\n\tSee ?dataentry for a description of the current user interface.\n\n    o\tR under Unix can be sent SIGUSR1 to quit and save or SIGUSR2\n\tto quit and save without running .Last and on.exit\n\texpressions.\n\n    o\tAdded ability to use the graphics device driver to perform\n\thorizontal justification of strings.  This is used in the\n\tx11(), windows(), postscript() and xfig() drivers and will\n\tlead to more accurate placing of centred or right-justified\n\tstrings.\n\n    o\tFormulas created with the tilde operator now contain the\n\tenvironment in which they were created.  The environment of a\n\tformula can be accessed with the environment() function.  This\n\tfacility is still experimental; it is intended to help\n\tsimplify writing modeling functions.\n\n\n    o\t$ and $&lt;- are now generic functions.\n\n    o\tadd1.glm() and drop1.glm() now allow test=&quot;F&quot;, which is\n\tappropriate for models with estimated dispersion.\n\n    o\tapprox() and approxfun() have an extra argument ties= to control\n\thandling of tied x values\n\n    o\tNew function as.symbol(), identical to as.name().\n\tis.symbol and is.name() are now identical by definition;\n\tbefore, they were equivalent by implementation.\n\n    o\tattach() now works for R data files.\n\n    o\taxis() now has additional arguments.  The argument &quot;tick&quot; turns\n\ttick drawing on and off (on by default).  Additional arguments\n\tline, pos, and outer; allow more flexible placement of axes.\n\n    o\tNew device bitmap(), like dev2bitmap() but a stand-alone device.\n\n    o\tboxplot() returns (and bxp() accepts) a list containing the summary\n\tstatistics for the boxes (changed from a list of elements one for\n\teach box).\n\n    o\tfile=&quot;|cmd&quot; is allowed (to pipe output to `cmd'), under cat()\n\tand postscript() and functions that use them (for example, write()).\n\n    o\tNew functions chartr() for general-purpose character translation\n\tin character vectors, and tolower() and toupper() for converting\n\talphabetic characters to lower-case and upper-case, respectively.\n\n    o\tcoplot() has new option subscripts=TRUE to pass the indices\n\tto the panel function.\n\n    o\tcor.test(method=&quot;spearman&quot;) might give slightly better P values,\n\tsince it now relies on pnorm() (with proper tail) instead of alnorm.\n\n    o\tdbinom() works for size=0 (where appropriate).\n\n    o\tNew trivial function det() for determinant computation\n\t(the example in ?qr did not seem to be sufficient).\n\n    o\tIf present in the package, a function .Last.lib will be called\n\twhen a package is detached.\n\n    o\tNew function dev.copy2eps() copies the current device to an eps\n\tfile, taking the size from that of the device.\n\n    o\tdev.print() now prints if possible, and takes the size from\n\tthe device being copied.\n\n    o\tedit() or fix() applied to a numeric or character matrix now\n\tuses the data editor, if available.\n\n    o\tedit.data.frame() edits factors in character mode by default,\n\tand will allow the row names to be edited, by default if they\n\tare not 1:nrow(name).\n\n    o\texpand.model.frame() for adding variables to a model frame.\n\n    o\tThe handling of estimating the dispersion in glm() fits has been\n\tchanged for consistency across methods.\t For `binomial' and\n\t`poisson' families the dispersion is always taken as one.\n\tFor `quasibinomial' and `quasipoisson' families it is always\n\testimated (by residual chisq/residual df).\n\n    o\tUsing &quot;~&quot; when specifying lib.loc (for example to help() or\n\tlibrary()) is now supported.\n\n    o\timage() has a new argument &quot;breaks&quot; and divides the zlim range\n\tinto equal-length intervals.\n\n    o\tinstall.packages() and update.packages() have a new `destdir'\n\targument for the directory to which to download the packages.\n\n    o\tNew function interaction.plot().\n\n    o\tInternal cleanup of lapply()'s C code.\n\n    o\tlibrary(), require(), and sys.source() have a new argument\n\t` keep.source = getOption(&quot;keep.source.pkgs&quot;) '.\n\tThis defaults to false, but can be set (also for base) to true\n\tby setting the environment variable R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE to &quot;yes&quot;\n\n    o\tPar `lty' in lines() now defaults to par(&quot;lty&quot;) not &quot;solid&quot;,\n\tfor consistency with plot().\n\n    o\tlist.files() [aka dir()]: path argument has now default = &quot;.&quot;\n\n    o\tlocator() allows inline graphics parameters (for the plotting\n\tit does with type !=&quot;n&quot;).\n\n    o\tNew function max.col() from MASS, thanks to V&amp;R.\n\n    o\tnlm() can now take additional arguments in ... to be passed to f.\n\n    o\tpar() returns elements in alphabetical order, and &quot;ann&quot; as a\n\tlogical (not integer).\n\n    o\t.Platform has a new component GUI specifying the GUI in use\n\t(which might be &quot;unknown&quot;).\n\n    o\tplot.formula() searches for a plot method for the left-side of the\n\tformula before searching for a plot method for the right-side of\n\tthe formula.\n\n    o\tNew bitmap devices png() and jpeg() on Unix/X11. (They were\n\talready available on Windows.)\n\n    o\tpostscript(print.it=TRUE) now does print the plot file.\n\tpostscript(onefile=FALSE) now produces multiple separate files.\n\n    o\tprovide() is now deprecated.\n\n    o\tNew function quade.test() in package ctest for the Quade test\n\tfor unreplicated blocked data.\n\n    o\tquantile(x, probs) now propagates NA/NaN in probs.\n\n    o\tOption for user-supplied normal random generator in RNGkind().\n\n    o\tread.fwf() is no longer dependent on Perl.\n\n    o\tNew arguments check.names and strip.white to read.table() and\n\tfriends.\n\n    o\tFunctions recordPlot() and replayPlot() save a plot to an R\n\tvariable and replay it.\n\n    o\tresiduals.lm() also allows types &quot;partial&quot; and &quot;response&quot;\n\tas residuals.glm().\n\n    o\tAdded col option to rug().\n\n    o\tscale() is now generic with scale.default method.\n\n    o\tNew &quot;call. = TRUE&quot; argument for stop(), and\n\tnew function  stopifnot(.) -- to be used in &quot;make check&quot;.\n\n    o\tstr(.) has a new optional argument &quot;nchar.max = 128&quot; and truncates\n\tstrings longer than that.  Also eliminated a few minor glitches.\n\n    o   The symbols() function is now implemented.\n\n    o\tNew function termplot() with similar functionality to\n\tplot.gam() in S.\n\n    o   The parameters to title() which specify the labels may now\n        be specified as a list containing the parameter together\n\twith additional modifying par values (cex, col, font) which\n\taffect just that label.\n\n\ttitle() also has new line and outer arguments which provide\n\tfunctionality which matches that in axis().\n\n    o\tNew functions which.min() amd which.max().\n\n    o\tThe Wilcoxon and Ansari-Bradley tests now optionally return\n\tconfidence intervals for the location or scale parameter of\n\tinterest.\n\n    o\tNew argument `extend' to window() (and updated documentation).\n\n    o\twrite.table() can now write CSV files in the format Excel expects.\n\n    o\tNew device xfig() to produce XFig files.\n\n    o\tNew xyz.coords() utility function to be used for 3D highlevel plots.\n\n\n    o\tR CMD build now also works for package bundles.\n\n    o\tRdconv allows an output file to be specified.\n\n    o\tInitial support for C++ source code in add-on packages under Unix.\n\n    o\tMathlib can be built as a standalone library: see directory\n\tsrc/nmath/standalone.\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tThe Mathlib functions now use exactly the same values for\n\t+/-Inf, NaN and NA as the rest of R in all cases.\n\n    o\tImproved automatic remaking.\n\n\n    o\toption keep.source was not set correctly before the base\n\tpackage was loaded: some functions in the base package had\n\tthe source kept.  The memory usage should now be reduced by ca 1Mb.\n\n    o\tThe base file is no longer closed twice in case of a syntax\n\terror (caused segfault on Linux).\n\n    o\tThe X11 data editor scrolls cells and so allows more than ca 10\n\tcharacters to be entered.  Several interface/redraw errors\n\thave been corrected.\n\n    o\tUsing `destroy' or `close' on the X11 data editor window killed R.\n\n    o\tMultiple `destroy' events or X11 errors killed R (PR#400).\n\n    o\tWarnings from .Last or closing devices are printed where\n\tsensible (e.g. not on GNOME nor Windows console).\n\n    o\tadd1.glm() and drop1.glm gave() incorrect results in the &quot;Chisq&quot;\n\ttest option when the scale was estimated.\n\n    o\taggregate() applied to multiple time series lost the series names.\n\n    o   as.hclust.twins() in package mva sets method=NA (PR#538)\n\n    o\tave(1:3) now works (as when is.null(list()) was TRUE years ago).\n\n    o\tbarplot(c(0.1, 0.5, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) now works: [xy]axs=&quot;i&quot;\n\tand exact limits now labels the limits.\n\n    o\tby() works when embedded in a function.\n\n    o\tThe xlab and ylab in coplot() now set the x and y axis labels,\n\tas in S.  Supply a second component to label the conditioning\n\tvariables.\n\n    o\tcount.fields() and read.table() now have the same default\n\tquote = &quot;\\&quot;'&quot;.\n\n    o\tguard against segfault in dataentry(x&lt;-1, Modes = plot), and the like.\n\n    o\tdev.print() now checks if the current device is replayable\n\t(and not all devices were, despite the documentation).\n\n    o\tThe gtk() device (formerly x11() under GNOME) was incorrectly\n\treturning character information, so in particular `*' was\n\twrongly centred as a plotting symbol.\n\n    o\tis.qr() checks not only for $qr, but also for $rank &amp; $qraux, PR#482.\n\n    o\tlibrary() will not leave the package on the search path if\n\tloading fails (including if .First.lib fails).\n\n    o\tlqs(, method=&quot;S&quot;) rounded k0 on passing to C.\n\n    o\tna.omit() now handles vectors and matrices as well as data\n        frames.\n\n    o\tplot.lm(*, which=4) now works thanks to Marcel Wolbers.\n\n    o\tpostscript() now uses the options &quot;papersize&quot; and &quot;printcmd&quot;\n\trather than the values of R_PAPERSIZE in the environment\n\tand R_PRINTCMD found at build time.\n\n    o\tpostscript() now makes use of kerning information in computing\n\tstring widths.\n\n    o\tM &lt;- 2 ; print(ppr(.., nterms = M))  now works.\n\n    o\tppr(, sm.method=&quot;spline&quot;) had an internal limit of 250 rows:\n\tthis is now 2500 and is now checked.\n\n    o\tpredict.lm(,type=&quot;terms&quot;,se.fit=T) gives correct standard errors\n\t(thanks to John Maindonald)\n\n    o\tprint.ftable() now returns its argument.\n\n    o\tproj.aovlist() now gives a non-zero result for strata with\n\tno fitted effects.\n\n    o\tqnorm() is now based on AS 241 instead of AS 111, and should\n\tgive precise results up to 16 digits precision.\n\n    o\trgeom(, prob=1) gives 0 rather than NA\n\n    o\trpois(*, lambda) now works when lambda &gt; .Machine$integer.max\n\n    o\tstrheight(&quot;X&quot;) with no active device would segfault.\n\n    o\tsystem() is now (partially) functional on systems without popen.\n\n    o\tFixed bug in undoc() - requiring new `chdir' argument\n\tfor sys.source()\n\n    o\tFixed problem in usemethod() where CAR(call) could be non-symbol.\n\n    o\tThe x11() device no longer crashes R if a font is not found,\n\tand will warn if there is a size mismatch of more than 10%.\n\n\n    o\tR CMD Rd2dvi now sorts files alphabetically.\n\n    o\tRdconv now reports if an invalid type is specified (rather\n\tthan using latex).\n\n    o\tSupport for Rd conversion to Sd has been reinstated (it was\n\tunintentionally removed along with nroff-based conversion to text).\n\n    o\t\\deqn{} fix in R-exts.texi, PR#523.\n\n\n    o\tLinpack.h now makes clear which routines are actually in R.\n\n    o\tEntry-point &quot;pythag&quot; is now loaded even though it is not\n\tnecessarily used in R.  Where &quot;hypot&quot; is available pythag\n\tjust calls hypot after checking for special values.\n\n    o\tcall_R will now correctly handle character vector arguments.\n\n    o   The alphabet links on top of HTML function indices with more than\n\t100 entries now contain only the letters which are really\n\tfirst letters of at least one entry.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

It should get to the CRAN master site within a few hours.\n\nThere's also a version split in three for floppies if you prefer\nthat.\n\nSince this is a major release, we've made a formal release\nstatement this time. Below is an excerpt; full text is available at \n\n<A HREF=\"http://developer.r-project.org/R-release-1.0.0.txt\">http://developer.r-project.org/R-release-1.0.0.txt</A>\n\n&quot;The release of a current major version indicates that we believe that\nR has reached a level of stability and maturity that makes it suitable\nfor production use. Also, the release of 1.0.0 marks that the base\nlanguage and the API for extension writers will remain stable for the\nforeseeable future. In addition we have taken the opportunity to tie\nup as many loose ends as we could.&quot;\n\n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant bit of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.0\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tThe entry points [dpq]norm no longer exist: the header file\n\tR_ext/Mathlib.h must be used and such code re-compiled.\n\n    o\tHeader files in R_ext must be given explicitly as e.g.\n\t&quot;R_ext/Mathlib.h&quot;.\n\n    o\tNew function  log1p(x) := log(1 + x) , accurate for |x| &lt;&lt; 1.\n\n    o\tHTML searches can now select between any combination of\n\ttitles, keywords and object names. The keyword list of\n\tSearchEngine.html is automatically built from KEYWORDS.db.\n\tMissing links are now resolved using the search engine.\n\n    o\tA data subdirectory of the working directory will be\n\tsearched for data, by default after all the loaded packages\n\t(including base).\n\n    o\tData directories can now be zipped as Rdata.zip, provided a\n\tlist of contents is provided in file `filelist'.\n\n    o\tNew function try(expr) which provides a user-friendly wrapper\n\tto restart().\n\n    o\tNew function geterrmessage() to retrieve the last error\n\tmessage, for use in try() and user's error handlers, and new\n\toption &quot;show.error.messages&quot; to control the printing of error\n\tmessages.\n\n    o\tpersp() now labels its axes.\n\n    o\t?plotmath documents the plotting expressions facility much\n\tmore comprehensively, with tables in the examples.\n\n    o\tNew functions dump.frames() and debugger() allow post-mortem\n\tdebugging.  See the help on debugger.\n\n    o\tNew functions by() and merge() to split and join data frames.\n\n    o   Generic methods now do &quot;match before dispatch&quot;, so\n        plot(pch=2, y ~ x) invokes plot.formula.  Notice that this will\n        break user code if it has renamed the dispatch argument and\n        uses the original name for a different argument.\n\n    o\tLong-named command-line options also allow `--name VALUE'.\n\n    o   arima0() now uses optim() rather than nlm(), and is thereby\n\tnormally faster and gives more accurate solutions.  Perhaps\n\tmore importantly, it fails to converge much less often.\n\n    o   Enhanced pairs() function allowing separate upper, lower and\n\tdiagonal panel functions and control of diagonal labels.\n\t(Much of this was contributed by Jens Oehlschlaegel-Akiyoshi.)\n\n    o\tLinks to R objects in other packages in help files can now be\n\tspecified explicitly as \\link[pkg]{topic} or\n\t\\link[pkg:maintopic]{topic}\n\n    o\toptim() has a new simulated annealing method contributed by\n\tAdrian Trapletti.\n\n    o   Hershey vector fonts are available in text() and contour().\n        Documentation for Hershey vector fonts is in help(Hershey).\n\n    o\tThe HTML function indices (for packages and for all installed\n\tfunctions) and the index to the reference manual now omit\n\tmethods for generic functions if they would immediately follow\n\tthe generic and refer to the same file. This reduces the\n\tclutter considerably.\n\n    o   New functions points.formula() and lines.formula() to supplement\n        plot.formula(). The latter has been enhanced so that all\n        arguments are now evaluated in the supplied data frame and all\n        subsettable arguments are subsetted. Notice that the data=\n        argument can no longer be given as a positional argument but\n        must be given in keyword form.\n\n    o   The behaviour of pmatch() has been changed to be S-compatible:\n\tin particular the meaning of duplicates.ok=TRUE has changed.\n\tThe help for pmatch and charmatch now gives more precise\n\tdescriptions, including of their differences.\n\n    o   print.hclust(), hclust() and dist() now store the method\n\tthat has been used.\n\n    o   If there are unmatched function argument(s), the first found\n\tis named in the message, for example\n\t`unused argument(s) (xlabel ...)'.\n\n    o   Conversion from Rd to raw nroff is no longer available.\n\n    o   text() now accepts vector &quot;col&quot;, &quot;cex&quot; and &quot;font&quot; arguments.\n\n    o   &quot;default&quot; is now a valid argument to RNGkind().\n\n    o   nlm() and optim() will now give up immediately they try to\n\tstep to a non-finite value: nlm at least would go into an\n\tinfinite loop.\n\n    o\t&quot;mostattributes(obj) &lt;- value&quot; utility useful for careful\n        attributes' inheritance; e.g. for fixing pmax/pmin (see below).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   (0.99.0a) The internal code for strsplit no longer destroys\n\tother internal structures, e.g. postscript file output on\n\tLinux.\n\n    o   (0.99.0a) nlm() no longer segfaults with Hessian specified.\n\n    o   (0.99.0a) Gnome version plotmath works, kind of\n\n    o   (0.99.0a) edit.data.frame() now handles character vectors\n        better, provided they were generated with I().\n\n    o   (0.99.0a) Attempt to special-case print-buffer allocation\n\twith just a format argument was abandoned, since there is\n\tno portable way of doing it and it caused compile problem\n\ton Alpha.\n\n    o   tempfile(&quot;&quot;) now works on all Unix platforms, and\n\ttempfile(&quot;a b c&quot;) returns a single name (with spaces in).\n\tThe file names are now unique across processes (Unix), are\n\tguaranteed not to exist and very likely to be unique within\n\tan R session.\n\n    o\tThe search semantics of data(), example() and help() have changed\n\t(see their help pages). In particular, they will normally\n\tlook in the package which was loaded, even if it is not in\n\tone of the libraries given in .lib.loc.\t Autoloads are no\n\tlonger included in the search (as they searched whole packages,\n\tnot just the autoloaded objects).\n\n    o\tThe documentation for .Rd files said &amp; must be entered as \\&amp;\n\tbut only the unescaped form was processed correctly. Now both\n\tare accepted but &amp; is preferred.\n\n    o\tlist.files now skips non-existent/unreadable directories with\n\ta warning, rather that failing with an error.\n\n    o\tLots of help examples now tidy up the files they created, and\n\tdetach data frames and libraries they attach.\n\n    o\tlibrary(help=foo) lists only contents of first version if\n\tmultiple matches are found on lib.loc.\n\n    o\tround(2.345e-99, 100) now works (not giving 0).\n\tC functions fprec() and fround() [= R's signif() and round()],\n\tnow use R_pow_di(10.0, n) which is clean and more efficient.\n\tThis changes some results in the least significant bits.\n\n    o   rpois sometimes had problems with mu=0, now special-cased\n\n    o   Rare memory overrun in rpois fixed.\n\n    o   --nsize and --vsize arguments to R CMD check now work.\n\n    o   plot.stepfun had renamed the dispatch argument and used the\n        original name &quot;x&quot; for a different argument which broke on the\n        new `match &amp; dispatch' code. Changed to &quot;xval&quot;.\n\n    o   The return value for par() was incorrectly documented, and in\n\tconsequence cpgram() was not re-setting &quot;pty&quot;.\n\n    o   package.dependencies() printed unnecessary debugging messages\n\t(version comparison): these have been removed.\n\n    o   backslashes in examples in help files are now converted\n\tcorrectly to latex.\n\n    o   qchisq with non-centrality parameter now does something.\n\n    o   Greek symbols are now converted correctly in HTML help (but\n\tonly rendered correctly on a few browsers).\n\n    o   rbind(x, y) works when x has no columns.\n\n    o   \\tabular in Rd files is rendered better in latex, and long\n\ttabular material is now acceptable (and split over pages).\n\n    o   evaluation depth wasn't properly reset by  &quot;next&quot;\n\n    o   Old (pre-0.63.1) .Random.seed would cause problems if used.\n\n    o   Row indexing of data.frames by characters (e.g. y[&quot;ab&quot;, ])\n\twas wrong, as pmatch was not S-compatible.\n\n    o   Contour labels used to be rounded to integers.\n\n    o   Calling rbinom() repeatedly with the same p but different n\n\tgave incorrect results.\n\n    o   Rd2contents assumed the \\name field was the file name, so\n\tsearches could lead to non-existent links.\n\n    o   Assigning functions to list elements is not longer disallowed.\n\n    o   Unified usage statement to R CMD xxx for all commands\n\n    o   Using duplicated new string indices in [&lt;- caused a crash on\n\tsome platforms, e.g. x &lt;- 1:2; x[c(&quot;3&quot;, &quot;3&quot;)] &lt;- 3; x.\n\n    o   rle() can now handle character vectors, as documented.\n\n    o   print.default failed to reset its settings, so, e.g. na.print\n\tcould persist when printing a list.\n\n    o   [cr]bind could sometimes return an invisible value.\n\n    o\taxis() and rug() sometimes extended the axis line too far.\n\trug() always clipped x values to the plot region, but now\n\tadmits to doing so with a warning.\n\n    o\tplot() and axis() got into trouble with very small relative\n\tranges: these are now required to be at least 100x the machine\n\tprecision.\n\n    o\tsplit.screen(, erase=TRUE) failed to create a new plot, so\n\tfailed if it was used on a postscript device before other plots.\n\n    o\tplotting with lwd = 0 also set the dash length to 0: now\n\tdash lengths are scaled up for lwd &gt; 1 but not reduced for\n\t0 &lt;= lwd &lt; 1.\n\n    o   plotting a &quot; &quot; vertically caused an X11 error with some fonts,\n        (notably URW fonts on RedHat) causing plot.lm to crash R\n\n    o   F distributions with huge DF now behave more sensibly\n\n    o   Crashes could occur if there was an error in inline\n        parameters, because the call was not being recorded. It is\n        now.\n\n    o   Title field of DESCRIPTION now overrides TITLE file.\n\n    o   R now reports `50 or more warnings', not just 50, as it only\n\tdisplays the first 50.\n\n    o   Resetting the RNG state resets the state of the Box-Muller\n\tgenerator too.\n\n    o   Pointer protection bug in load() code.\n\n    o\tAssignment with unknown string index caused memory corruption\n        when used on matrices.\n\n    o\tIt is now possible to call Fortran routines d1mach and 11mach\n\ton platforms which do not append underscores.\n\n    o\tAdditions to plots by identify() and locator() were not being\n\trecorded, and so did not appear when a plot was copied or\n\tprinted.\n\n    o\tThe defaults for `na.action' arguments were inconsistently\n\tdocumented. In R the default is taken from the\n\toptions(na.action) setting, and that defaults to `na.omit'.\n\tIf there is no `na.action' setting, the default is `na.fail'.\n\tFor consistency, the default for replications() has been\n\tchanged.\n\n    o   Fix cases with lambda==0 in Poisson distribution\n\n    o   demo(is.things) had been broken by the introduction of is.element.\n\n    o   palette() didn't check for overflow and was limited to 256\n        colors, so palette(colors()) would segfault. Limit increased\n        to 1024 and check inserted.\n\n    o\tC functions fprec() and fround() [= R's signif() and round()],\n\tnow use R_pow_di(10., n) which is clean and more efficient.\n\tThis changes some results in the least significant bits.\n\n    o\tpmin(c(a=1), 2:3) now works {and pmax(.) too}.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

I.e. this is your chance to\nhelp us making version 1.0.0 as bug-free as possible.\n\nNotice that GNOME support is still experimental. In particular,\nplotting of mathematical formulas is pretty much out of whack at the\nmoment. \n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\nHere's the relevant bit of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 0.99.0\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tThe ``Introduction to R'' manual, in doc/manual.\n\tThe ``Writing R Extensions'' manual is much enhanced for\n\tthis release.\n\n    o\tThe format for save/load has been changed. Workspaces and\n\tobjects saved in earlier versions can be loaded into this\n\tversion, but not conversely. Use save() or save.image() with\n\targument oldstyle=TRUE to save in the old format if you need to.\n\n    o\tThe header files for C code have been reorganised. The\n\tpreferred header file for user code is now &quot;R.h&quot;, and\n\tancillary files such as Arith.h now need to be referred to\n\tas &quot;R_ext/Arith.h&quot;. The `Writing R Extensions' manual now\n\tcontains the beginnings of a description of the public API and\n\thow to use it.\n\n    o\tMany of the exported symbols have been remapped or hidden. This\n\tmeans that code using Rdefines.h or Rinternals.h or Mathlib.h\n\twill need to be re-compiled, and code using Applic.h may do\n\tso.\n\n\tMany packages will need to be re-installed for use with this\n\trelease.\n\n    o\tThe random number generation interface has changed, although\n\tsaved .Random.seed's will work unchanged. The default\n\tgenerator is now Marsaglia's multicarry, and the Mersenne\n\tTwister GFSR and Knuth's Fibonacci subtraction are also\n\tavailable.  The type of normal generation can be selected by\n\tRNGkind() (and is encoded in .Random.seed).\n\n\tThe new function set.seed() which uses a single integer to set\n\tthe random number seeds is now the recommended way to do so.\n\n\tIt is now possible for a user to plug-in in a new RNG written\n\tin C: consult ?Random and ?Random-user for the details.\n\n    o\tAll the DPQ {probability density quantile} functions have new\n\targuments, &quot;lower_tail = TRUE&quot; and &quot;log{_p} = FALSE&quot;.  This allows\n\tmore precise results when values would be close to 0 or 1.\n\n    o\tR CMD Rd2dvi has new options --pdf, --title and --output.\n\n    o\tNew fields Date, URL and Title in the DESCRIPTION file of\n\tpackages. The Title field replaces the separate TITLE file of\n\tpackages, which is no longer necessary.\n\n    o\tresiduals.lm() has a &quot;type&quot; argument, as S does.\n\n    o\tThe underlying code for nlm has been translated from Fortran\n\tto C and made re-entrant (changes contributed by Saikat DebRoy).\n\n    o\toptimize() can now be used recursively.\n\n    o\tNew suite of optimization methods optim(), covering\n\tNelder-Mead, BFGS quasi-Newton and conjugate-gradients methods\n\tfor unconstrained minimization and maximization with and\n\twithout derivatives.\n\n\toptim() also allows box constraints (interval bounds on\n\tindividual variables) in its limited-memory BFGS option.\n\n    o\tR now compiles in the GNU version of regex, so regular\n\texpressions (grep, sub, gsub, regexpr, &quot;pattern&quot; in ls) are\n\talways available. The class of regular expressions supported\n\tis now slightly wider on some Unix platforms.\n\n    o\tpackage ctest (for classical tests) is now part of the base\n\tdistribution, and also contains chisq.test, prop.test and\n\tt.test which previously were in package base. These three\n\tfunctions are auto-loaded from ctest.\n\n    o\tNew utility `R CMD build' for building add-on packages along\n\twith some useful testing and cleaning up.\n\n    o\tConversion of .Rd help files to text format is done in Perl,\n\tand no longer requires nroff.  This makes the conversion 8-bit\n\tclean and more accurate.\n\n    o\tBuilding help for a package now removes help files that no\n\tlonger exist in the source.\n\n    o\tstrsplit() now uses split regexps, and no longer insists on\n\tsplitting into non-empty tokens.\n\n    o\tLong-named options with arguments such as `--vsize' now use the\n\t`--name=VALUE' form; the old `--name VALUE' is deprecated.\n\tThe old-style command line options `-v' and `-n' are now defunct.\n\n    o\tpar(&quot;cxy&quot;) { == par(&quot;cin&quot;)/par(&quot;pin&quot;) in user coordinates}\n\tfor S compatibility.\n\n    o\tIf R_PAPERSIZE is not specified otherwise, configure now tries\n\tto compute it by calling paperconf.\n\n    o\tThe deprecated alternative RPROFILE is no longer accepted: use\n\tR_PROFILE instead.\n\n    o\tAdded setequal() for set equality.\n\n    o\tFirst argument renamed to &quot;package&quot; for library(), require(),\n\tprovide().\n\n    o\tmodel.frame() now accepts data= arguments that can be coerced to\n\tdata frames.\n\n    o\tHelp files can now contain \\describe groups.\n\n    o\tHyperlinks in help files can now use LaTeX special characters.\n\n    o\trstandard() now also works for glm objects.\n\n    o\tglm drops 0-weight observations when fitting so that the\n\toutput is compatible with lm.influence() and plot.lm().\n\n    o\tNew function ftable() for creating and manipulating flat\n\tcontingency tables.\n\n    o\tNew function cutree() for cutting hclust trees in package\n\tmva.  New functions rect.hclust() and identify.hclust().\n\n    o\tUnder Unix, the default editor is obtained from the environment\n\tvariables EDITOR or VISUAL if either is set.\n\n    o\tNew command line option `--gui' to specify the graphical user\n\tinterface under Unix.  Currently, possible values are `X11' (the\n\t(default) and `GNOME', provided that GNOME support is available.\n\tCommand line options \\`-g' and `--gnome' are defunct.\n\n    o\tpower.t.test() and power.prop.test() functions added for power and\n\tsample size calculations.\n\n    o\tedit() is now generic and a new edit.data.frame() function\n\tcalls up the spreadsheet data editor. This is still rather\n\trudimentary, since the data editor really only knows about\n\tnumeric and character vectors.\n\n    o\tModifications to the data editor so that one can use ESC to\n\tquit a partial cell entry and entering an empty cell causes\n\tthe element to be set to NA.\n\n    o\tprop.table() and margin.table() functions (these are *really* trivial).\n\n    o\tR INSTALL checks the Depends field of DESCRIPTION if the\n\tcurrently running version of R meets an R\n\tdependency. old.packages() reports only packages conforming\n\tto the current version of R. New function\n\tpackage.dependencies() for parsing and checking dependencies.\n\n    o\toptions(&quot;expressions&quot;) now does something, and the evaluation\n\tdepth is checked on all platforms (not just Macintosh). This\n\twill catch infinite recursions gracefully.\n\n    o\tThe default number of cons cells (`nsize') is now 350k (it\n\twas 250k).  This reflects the added base code and packages,\n\tand increases memory usage by about 2Mb (on a 32-bit machine).\n\n    o\tSome simple multiple comparison procedures: p.adjust() for\n\tgeneric adjustment of a set of p values by variants of the\n\tBonferroni method; pairwise.t.test, pairwise.wilcox.test,\n\tpairwise.prop.test for pairwise comparisons of grouped data\n\tand proportions.\n\n    o\tError / warning calls with a long description of the call are\n\tsplit into two lines. (This helps avoid scrolling in the\n\tWindows GUI.)\n\n    o\tlapply() is now internal and substantially faster (7% overall\n\tspeed-up on the tests for the base package).\n\n    o\tapply() no longer names the output dimensions unless FUN returns\n\ta result with names, and the same names for every result.\n\n    o\tcontour() can (at last) label contours by level.\n\n    o\tpersp() labels its axes.\n\n    o\tscan() and read.table() now have a dec= argument to set the\n\tdecimal point character. If sep= is set, quoting of strings is\n\tnow possible and follows the conventions for comma-separated\n\tfiles. This should make it easier to read the &quot;continental\n\tCSV&quot; format (fields separated by semicolon and using comma as\n\tdecimal point).\t The set of quoting characters has also been\n\tmade optional. Variants of read.table(), read.csv() and\n\tread.csv2() have been defined\n\n    o\tHDF5 support is gone from the R distribution, and provided by an\n\tadd-on package available from CRAN.\n\n    o\tNew function getOption() for retrieving the value of a single\n\toption.\n\n    o\tread.table.url() and related functions now use download.file,\n\twhich has an extra &quot;socket&quot; method for direct HTTP socket\n\tconnection. download.file has new option ``quiet''.\n\n    o\tpairs.default() has an oma argument to allow users to override\n\tthe internal setting of that graphics parameter.\n\n    o\tprincomp() in package mva allows the user to specify the\n\tcovariance matrix (and hence use, e.g. cov.mve).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tsvd(matrix(2,1,0)),\n\tarma0f(NULL), cancor(F,F) and prcomp(F[F]) no longer segfault.\n\n    o\tloess.smooth(F[F],F[F]) and supsmu(F[F],F[F]) no longer segfault.\n\n    o\tsave(1, file = &quot;&quot;[F])  no longer segfaults.\n\n    o\tstop(list()) and warning(list()) no longer segfault.\n\n    o\tsystem(&quot;&quot;[F]) and save(1, file = &quot;&quot;[F])\t no longer segfault.\n\n    o\tOverflow of the pointer protection stack is handled correctly\n\n    o\tpredict.glm(, type=&quot;link&quot;, se.fit=T) works\n\n    o\tstr() now works with Surv(.) objects from library(survival5).\n\n    o\tall.equal(-Inf, -1e5) now gives &quot;Mean absolute difference: Inf&quot;\n\tinstead of &quot;Mean relative  difference: NaN&quot;.\n\n    o\tstrsplit fix broke copy.url.\n\n    o\t0 ^ -1 == Inf  and  min(NA, NaN) is now always NA\n\n    o\tR CMD xxx sets $R_HOME/bin to be first in PATH\n\n    o\tAdded more warnings to update.packages &amp; friends. New function\n\told.packages for better control of update.packages.\n\n    o\tAdding matrices to data frames now happens column by column as\n\tdocumented, so character or logical matrices generate factor\n\tcolumns.\n\n    o\tFormulae containing interactions with the response were\n\thandled incorrectly by model.matrix, giving wrong answers or crashes.\n\n    o\tanova(lm(.)) with 0 weights now works.\n\n    o\tplot.lm(), dffits(), covratio() now do the right thing for weighted\n\tlm regression.\n\n    o\tformatC(as.integer(c(1,0,NA))) now works. PR#394, thanks to Jens O.-A.\n\n    o\tformat.char(.) is much faster for long vector argument [Jens O.-A.]\n\n    o\t\\enumerate now enumerates in text conversion of .Rd files.\n\n    o\tglm() no longer fails with names&lt;- errors in cases where\n\tobservations with fits on the mu.eta boundary have been dropped.\n\n    o\tDeviance residuals could be NaN instead of 0 by rounding error.\n\n    o\tshapiro.test(x) now gives better error messages (eg. x=rep(1,5))\n\tand doesn't print ANYTHING anymore (in some cases).\n\n    o\tmode(as.formula(paste(&quot;~&quot;, paste(1:50, collapse=&quot;+&quot;)))[2]) now works.\n\n    o\tglm() now handles cases with numerically 0 or 1 fitted values in\n\tbinomial and numerically 0 in poisson correctly. (Previously\n\tthese observations were dropped even though the variances were\n\talso numerically 0.)\n\n    o\t(-4 + 0i) ^ (1/2)  now gives 2i.\n\n    o\tsystem.time() now does sensible things in the non-HAVE_TIMES\n\tcase, and that and proc.time() have better documentation.\n\n    o\tA couple of bugs in the data editor spreadsheet have been\n\teliminated.\n\n    o\tElapsed time in proc.time() is no longer rounded to whole\n\tseconds under Unix.\n\n    o\tAssigning character vectors to subsets of data frames now\n\tworks correctly (it used to assign the numeric codes of factors).\n\n    o\tExtensive enhancements and corrections to the help pages.\n\n    o\tThe possibility of buffer overruns during printing has been\n\tmuch reduced, and eliminated on systems with vsnprintf.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

Package bundles such as VR can be\n        directly installed both from the shell and from inside R.\n\n    o   RLIBS is no longer accepted as well as R_LIBS (which has been\n        the documented form since 0.65.0).\n\n    o   demo(nlm) has examples of using analytical gradients and\n        Hessians.\n\n    o   .Platform$OS.type is standardized to be `unix', `mac' or `windows'\n\n    o   setting cex in matplot(matrix(1:25,5), cex=1:5) now works\n\n    o   ar.ols() has separate demean and intercept arguments, uses\n        internal scaling for greater accuracy.\n\n    o   xxxPR functions allow NCHAR=-1 for S compatibility.\n\n    o   `Rcomplex' is preferred to `complex' (a future reserved word\n        in C) for R complex objects passed to C.\n\n    o   new function dir.create() for platform-independence.\n\n    o   help.search() creates a database for faster searching later in\n        the R session.\n\n    o   density() allows for more kernels and has a new argument\n        `give.Rkern' to access the relevant kernel property.\n\n    o   multivariate methods for ar: &quot;yule-walker&quot; (now in C) and\n        &quot;burg&quot; (new) contributed by Martyn Plummer.\n\n    o   New data sets `HairEyeColor' (hair and eye color of statistics\n        students), `Titanic' (survival of passengers on the Titanic),\n        and `UCBAdmissions' (student admissions at UC Berkeley).\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Many help pages have been revised and enhanced.\n\n    o   predict.glm() works again with type=&quot;link&quot;.\n\n    o   subscripting arrays and matrices no longer loses the names of\n        the dimnames vector.  Transpose also preserves the names.\n\n    o   examples in help files containing \\testonly are no longer\n        (partially) duplicated.\n\n    o   is.numeric() of a factor is now FALSE\n\n    o   prevent a segfault in plotmath\n\n    o   f &lt;- get(&quot;function&quot;); f(,); f(F,F)  now &quot;ok&quot; (PR#361).\n\n    o   blank-line reject code in parse.dcf was wrong (Martyn Plummer)\n\n    o   made filled.contour independent of pointsize. Make plot key\n        wider so there's room for a title. Touchup example.\n\n    o   font size fixups for the X11 driver (mainly)\n\n    o   some.list[[NA]] is NULL, following S, rather than giving spurious\n        error messages\n\n    o   segfault when running out of heap\n\n    o   segfault in rbind of a vector without names fixed. cbind, too.\n\n    o   fixed symbol size problems with PostScript driver\n\n    o   unique() &amp; duplicated() only work for atomic vectors;\n        unique(data.frame(&quot;&quot;[F])) doesn't segfault anymore.\n\n    o   get(&quot;attr&lt;-&quot;)(&quot;&quot;[0],&quot;&quot;[0]) doesn't segfault anymore.\n\n    o   blunder in do_memoryprofile, causing segfault on Alpha machines\n\n    o   erroneous error message in coerceToSymbol\n\n    o   partial workaround for workspace restore problems. This can\n        happen if an environment on the search path is assigned to a\n        variable which gets saved. The error &quot;unresolved node during\n        restore&quot; is turned into a warning, allowing the rest of the\n        workspace to be restored, but the variable contains an empty\n        environment on reload.\n\n    o   density(x) now works also when IQR(x) == 0.\n        density(x, window=...) now works [S compatibility].\n\n    o   prevent points from being plotted if pch, cex, or col are NA.\n        Does not apply to bg on pch 21--25 (where NA means\n        &quot;transparent&quot;) because it would require fixes at the driver\n        level.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

The jump in version number\nindicates that we are approaching version 1.0, more than a &quot;quantum\nleap&quot; in functionality.\n\nYou can get it from (notice that we have changed servers in Wisconsin\nwith much better availability and new names)\n\n<A HREF=\"ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz\">ftp://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz</A> \n\nor\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz\">http://cvs.r-project.org/pub/CRAN/src/base/R-0.90.0.tgz</A>\n\nor wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.\n\nThere's also a version split in two for floppies if you prefer that.\n\n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\n\nHere is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n        **************************************************\n        *                                                *\n        *              0.90 SERIES NEWS                  *\n        *                                                *\n        **************************************************\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   packages splines (for regression smoothing splines or\n        interpolating splines) and nls (nonlinear least squares) are\n        part of the base distribution.\n\n    o   New error handling using\n        options ( error = expression(..) ,  warning.expr = ... ).\n        REPLACING version 0.65.1's  options(error.halt = T/F)\n\n    o   collected warnings before an error are no longer lost but\n        are printed after the error message (unless the error makes\n        this impossible).\n\n    o   A couple of substantial graphics changes, esp. in the X11\n        driver. The scaling of symbols is now linear in cex=, rather\n        than being tied to the available font's size. The fonts on an\n        X11 device also scale linearly with cex= insofar as your X\n        server can do it. On systems with the scalable type 1\n        PostScript fonts installed, this looks particularly nice. Note\n        that the scaling is linear in the *diameter*, but quadratic in\n        area. The distance between lines of margin text in the X11\n        device is now proportional to the size given to\n        x11(pointsize).\n\n\n    o   abline(a,b) now (again) refers to transformed coordinates on\n        plots with log-axes, so that abline(lm(log10(y)~log10(x)))\n        (say) draws a best-fitting line on a log-log plot. The earlier\n        convention (to draw a curve representing a line in original\n        coordinates) is available using a new untf= argument.\n\n    o   barplot.default() has new `axisnames' (and `sub') arguments, easily\n        allowing suppression of bar labeling.\n\n    o   cbind() and rbind() now actually do what deparse.level=1 implies:\n        add column/row names based on the deparsed argument, provided it\n        is a simple symbol. The behaviour is still hardcoded, though.\n\n    o   gc() now reports the total sizes in Mb as well as numbers.\n\n    o   New function help.search() for searching the names, titles,\n        aliases, or keywords in the help system.\n\n    o   image() allows x and y to specify either the boundaries or the\n        midpoints of the cells. If the latter, the whole cells are\n        drawn, rather than the outer cells being half-sized as previously.\n\n    o   NULL extra arguments to model.frame() are now treated as missing\n        (instead of an error).\n\n    o   optimization with nlm() can use analytic gradients and Hessians\n        if they are supplied.\n\n    o   on.exit() allows add=TRUE.\n\n    o   function parse.dcf() for parsing files in debian control file format\n        (DESCRIPTION, CONTENTS, ...)\n\n    o   predict.{g}lm has a type=&quot;terms&quot; option, and residual.glm has\n        type=&quot;partial&quot; as a step towards plot.gam().\n\n    o   New arguments to q() and quit() allow the exit status to be set\n        and the execution of .Last() to be skipped.\n\n    o   New function regexpr(), similar to grep but returns the position\n        of the match in each string. (For S-PLUS compatibility.)\n\n    o   scan() now supports complex numbers.\n\n    o   New function sort.list, for S compatibility. (This has argument\n        partial, but always sorts completely.)\n\n    o   storage.mode&lt;- can be used to set &quot;single&quot;, and if setting\n        anything other than &quot;single&quot; it removes the &quot;Csingle&quot; attribute.\n\n    o   new function sunflowerplot().\n\n    o   New function undoc() for listing undocumented objects.\n\n\n    o   User's .Rprofile now executes in global environment\n\n    o   All HTML pages now use the new style sheet doc/html/R.css\n\n    o   html and text files have now a header line giving the name of\n        the help file and the package. The description section now\n        comes first.\n\n    o   All the standard packages have DESCRIPTION files with\n        &quot;Priority: base&quot;, so installed.packages and\n        package.description will work with them.\n\n    o   The R-external manual which describes programming for the\n        .Call and .External interfaces is in the doc/manual directory.\n\n    o   New target `make pdf' in doc/manuals makes hyperlinked PDF \n        documentation. (This is experimental for this release. See\n        doc/manual/README for further details.)\n\n\n    o   S.h now contains (via Rdefines.h) a MESSAGE macro, and\n        Free NULLs the pointer, for compatibility with S3 (but not S4).\n\n    o   New subroutine REALPR callable from Fortran (like DBLEPR but\n        for real arguments): useful if as.single is in use.\n\n    o   The cex= argument to plot() etc. can be a vector, like pch=.\n\n    o   lty=0 now (again) makes lines invisible.

Switch to relative scale. (Thanks to Matt Wiener)\n\n    o   density() should work better with NAs and infinite values. See\n        ?density for the current definitions of how these are handled.\n\n    o   diag(x) now works (as pre 0.65.1) for 1-d arrays.\n\n    o   Stored-source was dropped by dump().\n\n    o   expand.grid returns a data frame even for one arg.\n\n    o   expand.grid(x) now also works for vector arguments x.\n\n    o   factor(list()) or factor(character(0)) *is* now a factor\n        with valid levels(.);\n        ordered does NOT allow an `ordered' argument anymore\n        and is now defined as trivial call to factor.\n\n    o   help page for gc gives correct size of cons cells (20 bytes\n        for 32-bit systems, 36 or more for 64-bit systems).\n\n    o   gcinfo reports correct percentages of heap even for vsize &gt; 200M.\n\n    o   gl(6,3,12) and gl(6,3,2) now both work.\n\n    o   Empty lists now deparse correctly.\n\n    o   na.omit.ts and na.contiguous preserve classes.\n\n    o   plot.factor {plot(&lt;factor&gt;)} now obeys axes=FALSE and xaxt=&quot;n&quot;.\n\n    o   read.table(as.is = TRUE) would leave everything as character.\n        Now it correctly tries to convert to numeric.\n\n    o   require() now has the warn.conflicts argument of library().\n\n    o   Fix problems in scan(flush = TRUE).\n\n    o   scan() got confused by trailing whitespace.\n\n    o   split(x,f) now works even when f is a factor with unused levels\n        (PR#294).\n\n    o   mosaicplot() has a formula interface and\n        NULL instead of NA default args.\n\n    o   stars() has &quot;NULL&quot; instead of &quot;NA&quot; defaults.\n\n    o   str() is quite a bit nicer with factors.\n\n    o   ts.union, cbind.ts, arithmetic on ts objects now allow\n        non-integer frequencies.\n\n\n    o   Switch to &lt;tt&gt; in HTML pages since Linux Netscape mangles\n        Courier.\n\n    o   When documentation is &quot;compiled&quot; (build-help), you now get warnings\n        for multiple (conflicting) \\alias{.} or \\name{.}s.\n\n    o   making the reference manual with `make dvi' copes better with\n        isolatin1 characters (but not perfectly as these are not in\n        standard TeX fonts).\n\n    o   Rd.sty now uses standard LaTeX constructs like \\bm for bold\n        math and \\url for URLs.\n\n\n    o   Protect R_fopen against NULL filename in Unix.\n\n    o   Math text in outer margins didn't work.\n\n    o   Text clipping now works in the X11 device.\n\n    o   Pixel rows sometimes got doubled in rotated text on the X11 device.\n\n    o   par(&quot;yaxt&quot;) is now ok.\n\n    o   Problems with realloc on some systems in AllocBuffer.\n\n    o   Problem with formatReal on non-IEEE systems.\n\n    o   demos/dynload/Makefile used macros that gave incorrect build\n        on some non-GNU makes.\n\n    o   Windows version copes better with paths with spaces in.\n\n    o   R CMD check had a typo which made the final message fail.\n\n    o   R_EOF redefined as -1, was causing trouble with isxxxx contructions.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

(If you use the patch file, you will miss a logo.bmp\nfile in the gnuwin32 directory, but that is probably immaterial to\nmost of you).\n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\n\nHere is the relevant part of the NEWS file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 0.65.1\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\t.C, .Fortran. .Call and .External now have an argument PACKAGE\n\tto specify the shared library to be used for the symbol. See\n\t?Foreign. Package writers are encouraged to use this.\n\n    o\tOn startup (unless --no-environ), first .Renviron is looked for in\n\tthe current directory, and then in $HOME/ (= ~/ ).\n\n    o\tNew options(error.halt = FALSE) (default is TRUE) allows\n\tcontinuation after an error in batch processing.\n\n    o\tIn graphics, lty has now 6 instead of 4 predefined line types.\n\n    o\tas.hclust.twins() in package mva to convert (and plot)\n\tobjects from agnes() and daisy() of package cluster.\n\n    o\tR INSTALL now can directly install pkg_version.tar.gz files\n\tas obtained from CRAN. New function update.packages()\n\t&amp; friends for automatically downloading packages from CRAN and\n\tinstall them on the fly (on Unix and Windows).\n\n    o\tNew function commandArgs() to record the command-line used.\n\n    o\tNew arguments `local' and `now' to dyn.load.\n\n    o\tdiag(x) now keeps names when appropriate and barfs when x is an array.\n\n    o\tfunctions source.url, url.show, read.table.url, scan.url to read\n\tfrom an http server instead of a file.\n\n    o\tgrid() gets useful defaults: grid lines drawn at tick marks.\n\n    o\tset operations union(), intersect(), setdiff() and is.element().\n\n    o\tNew function stars() for star plots and segment diagrams of\n\tmultivariate data.\n\n    o\tVersion info now in the top-level file `VERSION'.\n\n    o\tbarplot has a &quot;plot = TRUE&quot; argument and now returns locations of\n\tall bars even when &quot;beside = TRUE&quot;.\n\n    o\thist has an &quot;nclass&quot; argument purely for S compatibility.\n\n    o\tCharacter strings can now, with most compilers, be passed\n\ton and from Fortran. See ?Foreign for details.\n\n    o\tFunctions as.single and single now have the effect with\n\t.C and .Fortran of passing a numeric argument as float/REAL\n\trather than as double/DOUBLE PRECISION, by setting the\n\tattribute &quot;Csingle&quot;. See ?Foreign for details.\n\n    o\tComparison of strings uses the current locale on systems where\n\tthis is available, and so is always consistent with the ordering\n\tused by sort().\n\n    o\tsapply  has a new argument USE.NAMES=TRUE  and now returns a named\n        result when its input was a character.\n\n    o\tplot.stepfun  has new arguments  lty and lwd.\n\n    o   x labels in boxplot now handled differently, so that math\n    \texpressions are allowed.\n\n    o\tpostscript() argument `onefile' now does something, and there\n\tis a new paper type `special' and new argument `pagecentre'.\n\tSee ?postscript for details.\n\n    o\tExperimental function dev2bitmap() to copy to a bitmap graphics format.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tcentering in text() will be more accurate, particularly on devices\n\twith full font metric information (postscript, x11, not windows).\n\n    o\targuments after --no-readline in the Unix version were ignored.\n\n    o\tcouldn't set attributes in hashed environments.\n\n    o\t[&lt;-.data.frame mishandled dfr[1] &lt;- 1 (forgotten drop=FALSE)\n\n    o\tsys.on.exit didn't work\n\n    o\tsys.parent didn't quite work either for n &gt;= 2.\n\n    o\tpar(&quot;mfg&quot;) was wrong, par(mfg=) switched to down columns. Now\n\tpar(mfrow/mfcol = c(nr, nc)) followed by par(mfg=c(i,j)) is\n\tthe preferred style.\n\n    o\tplot( &lt;aov.object&gt; ) failed after 2nd plot, PR#279\n\n    o\tSeveral patches for systems with long != int.\n\n    o\tapprox failed if inputs contained NAs.\n\n    o\tweighted lm fits with 1 diml x failed if any weight was zero.\n\n    o\tlm.influence failed when there were undetermined coefficients, PR#280.\n\n    o\tproblem with function()... inside saved functions because arg count\n\tincreased to accommodate stored source. (Incorrect number of\n\targuments to &quot;lambda&quot;)\n\n    o\timprovements to generation of HTML help files: should work\n\tbetter on viewers other than Netscape.\n\n    o\tstl in package ts could conflict with package leaps: the Fortran\n\tsymbols have been changed.\n\n    o\thelp page for factor is improved and corrected.\n\n    o\tna.omit.ts and na.contiguous now preserve time-series attributes.\n\n    o\tmore automatic testing (&quot;make check&quot;) using options(error.halt=FALSE)\n\tled to the elimination of dozens (!) of seg.fault possibilities.\n\n    o\tfamily quasi handles zero observations with var=mu^2 more correctly.\n\n    o\tdynamically-loaded libraries are searched last-loaded first, as\n\tdocumented (under Unix it used to be first-loaded first).\n\n    o\trowsum failed with a matrix and a single group (drop=FALSE needed).\n\n    o\tderiv(y ~ &lt;expr&gt;(x)) now works as well as  deriv(~ &lt;expr&gt;(x)).\n\n    o\tqr over-estimated ranks in some degenerate cases.\n\tqr did not work correctly if n &lt; p and the first n cols were\n\trank-deficient.\n\n    o\tstr() wouldn't work quite right for named characters;  doesn't quote\n\tsymbols anymore.\n\n    o\tColour conversion (rgb, gray, hsv) truncated doubles and so\n\tgave machine-dependent results on the examples. It now rounds.\n\n    o\tcat() now admits again that it can't handle lists instead of\n\t&quot;random&quot; segfaulting.\n\n    o\tMore accurate rounding (including rounding to even) on platforms\n\twithout rint (e.g. Windows).\n\n    o\tqgeom() is now left-continuous with a tolerance, and so the\n\texample on the help page will be platform-independent.\n\n    o\tpretty() has been changed to use tolerance around integers and\n\tso will be more platform-independent. The exact output has\n\tprobably changed on all platforms for some input.\n\n    o\timage() &amp; filled.contour() now work for 1x1 matrices\n\tand with constant z values.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

With the current transfer\nspeed from Auckland, you probably don't need a deterrent anyway...\n\nFor those who are too curious to wait, I'll put a copy in\n\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.65.0.tgz\">ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.65.0.tgz</A> \n\nThere's also a version split in two for floppies if you prefer that.\n\n\tFor the R Core Team,\n\n\tPeter D.\n\n\nThe relevant part of the NEWS file follows below. In addition, GNOME\nsupport, although still experimental, has been considerably improved.\nYou'll need a substantial amount of support libraries, see the INSTALL\nfile for details.\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tA first step in improving performance has been made.\n\tAttached objects, libraries etc are now hashed; performance\n\tgains will be particularly apparent if large packages are in use.\n\n    o\tFirst version of package ts for time-series analysis.\n\tThis has fairly complete S-PLUS compatibility, but more features\n\tare planned. See library(help=ts) for details.\n\n    o\twarnings can be collected (options(warn=0), the default), printed\n\timmediately (options(warn=1)) or turned into errors (options(warn=2)).\n\tAs a consequence, all warnings and errors now are printed followed\n\tby a newline, if one is not supplied. (This should improve the\n\tS compatibility of the use of PROBLEM ... in compiled code.)\n\n\n\n    o\tAll R environment variables are now of the form `R_xxx'.  In\n\tparticular, `RHOME', `RLIBS' and `RPROFILE' are now called\n\t`R_HOME', `R_LIBS', and `R_PROFILE'.\n\n    o\tThe handling of q()/quit()/EOF has been changed, with a new option\n\t&quot;default&quot;.  In interactive use this asks unless --save or --no-save\n\thas been specified: if these are specified they set the default.\n\n    o\tLimited capability for tilde expansion of file names even without\n\treadline (on Unix, and on Windows).\n\n    o\tNew environment variables `R_HISTFILE' and `R_HISTSIZE' for the\n\tname and size of the history file.\n\n    o\tAttempting to restore (at startup) too large a .RData is now\n\ta fatal error.\n\n    o\tThe loading of shared library on Unix now uses RTLD_NOW not\n\tRTLD_LAZY.  This means that all symbols must be resolvable\n\twhen the library is loaded, and R will not terminate later\n\twhen a missing symbol is called.  Code which had missing symbols\n\t(including some packages) will need to be re-compiled.\n\n\n\n    o\tNew generic function all.equal();\n\tmost useful for numerical comparisons `up to rounding errors'.\n\n    o\tNew function boxplot.formula() as a formula interface to boxplots.\n\n    o\tNew functions getwd() and setwd() for getting and setting the R\n\tworking directory, basename() and dirname() for manipulating paths.\n\n    o\tFunction locator(, type=) is implemented to plot points or\n\tdraw lines interactively.\n\n    o\tFunctions new.env() to create empty environment and local() to\n\tallow local evaluation of expressions, with various useful\n\tidiomatic uses.\n\n    o\tConvenience functions parent.frame() and eval.parent().\n\n\n\n    o\tA new scheme for keeping source code with user-defined\n\tfunctions has been implemented. In particular, comments\n\twill no longer move about or disappear. The flip side of the\n\tcoin is that you can no longer rely on R to indent your\n\tcode for you. The stored-source facility can be turned\n\toff with options(keep.source=FALSE), and for an individual\n\tfunction by deleting the &quot;source&quot; attribute.\n\n\tIf the source attribute is absent, the function will be\n\tdeparsed for editing or printing, but any comments will be\n\tlost.\n\n    o\texpressions have gained semantics that are closer to\n\tthose of S. They don't get evaluated except when explicitly\n\tspecified. Example:\n\n\te &lt;- expression(x); e[[1]] &lt;- expression(123); eval(e)\n\n\tnow gives expression(123), not 123. This fixes some problems\n\twith expressions in the list argument to do.call().\n\n\n\n    o\tcontrast() no longer drops colnames for 1DF contrasts.\n\tConsequentially, the labels of regression coefficients for binary\n\tfactors contain level names (again ...).\n\n    o\tna.omit() and na.fail() are now generic.\n\n    o\tplot.lm() has more options and now does 4 plots by default, should\n\talso be okay for &quot;glm&quot; object; all thanks to John Maindonald.\n\n    o\tIf the dimnames of a table are themselves named, then their names\n\tare used to label the respective dimensions in tabular output.\n\n    o\tchisq.test() now optionally computes the p-value by Monte Carlo\n\tsimulation (in the standard case of a 2-d contigency table).\n\n    o\tsource() has a new argument `chdir' for changing the working\n\tdirectory to that of the file being sourced when evaluating.\n\n    o\tIf data() loads an R source file, it now changes the working\n\tdirectory (to that containing the file) when evaluating.\n\n    o\tInterpret strings NaN and Inf in character to numeric conversions\n\t(and thereby in read.table)\n\n    o\tThe presence of an object `.conflicts.OK' in a package suppresses\n\tconflict checking in library() for that package.\n\n    o\tuniroot() can now be used recursively.\n\n    o\thdf5{read|write} now allow more kinds of attributes and add support\n\tfor HDF5 version 1.2 (or newer)\tthanks to Marcus G. Daniels.\n\tConfigure checks for HDF5 1.2 availability, older versions will \n\tno longer work. \n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tx ^ y  gives proper results when x or y are infinite.\n\n    o\tThe semantics of &lt;&lt;- have been corrected.  The search for\n\ta variable binding to modify now begins one level &quot;up&quot; from\n\tthe current one.   Thus S and R semantics in &quot;non-closure&quot;\n\tfunctions will be identical.\n\n    o\t.Last() is called when terminating with q() (not just with EOF).\n\n    o\tabline() now understands the &quot;lwd&quot; graphics parameter if it\n\tis supplied as an inline argument.\n\n    o\taxis() now sorts `labels' when it sorts `at'.\n\n    o\tSome small changes have made in the axis drawing code to\n\tensure that tick-mark label alignment is correct for\n\tnon-default values of the &quot;las&quot; parameter.\n\n    o\tImproved error message from check.options().\n\n    o\tcm.colors(n) now doesn't append silly &quot;v=1&quot;; works for n=0, n=1.\n\n    o\tcooks.distance() now also works for &quot;glm&quot; objects;\n\tdeviance.lm() now ok for the case of weights.\n\n    o\tdate() doesn't return a final &quot;\\n&quot; (again ...).\n\n    o\tdiag() and diag&lt;- now handle correctly matrices with zero rows or cols.\n\n    o\thelp([&lt;-.factor) (etc) work again.\n\n    o\tis.recursive(list(.)) is now TRUE [PR#221].\n\n    o\tlog(0) gives -Inf on all architectures.\n\n    o\tWhen persp() was the first graphics command given to R it gave\n\tthe error &quot;plot.new() has not been called yet&quot;.  This no\n\tlonger happens.\n\n    o\tpgamma() gave 0 or 1 for extreme arguments too soon.\n\n    o\tplot(&lt;function&gt;, log=&quot;x&quot;) doesn't give a silly warning any more.\n\n    o\tThe internals of postscript() have been changed so that line\n\ttextures (dotted dashed etc) look better.  The use of the\n\tPostScript &quot;initclip&quot; operator has been removed so that we\n\tcan(?) really claim eps compliance.\n\n    o\trevsort() misbehaved if n&lt;=1, causing sample(1,1,,1) to\n\tsegfault\n\n    o\tseq(along = v) { and seq(v) when length(v) &gt; 1 } now returns\n\ta result of mode &quot;integer&quot;.\n\n    o\tsplit.default() now uses subscripting for x with a non-null\n\tclass, this preserves, e.g., the class of factors\n\n    o\tsubstr/substring(), deparse(), dput(), dump(), print()\n\twill work for arbitrarily long strings.\n\n    o\twhich(x) failed when x had names and contained NAs.\n\n    o\tDefault editor files (e.g. from fix()) are now removed at termination.\n\n    o\tTypos in NegBinomial.Rd (Negative Binomial distrib), thanks to Ch. Gu.\n\n    o\ta clipping problem for plots when there non-zero outer margins\n\thas been fixed.\t This problem used to affect coplot() and pairs().\n\n    o   get(&quot;zzz&quot;, mode=&quot;xxx&quot;) missed promise objects.\n\n    o   match.fun failed when a data frame was attached containing a \n\t&quot;length&quot; variable (e.g.)\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

In addition, a function\n\tcm.colors() which implements a Cleveland-style cyan-magenta\n\tpalette has been added.\n\n    o\tPrimitive function .External() to call dynamically loaded\n\t`internal'-style functions (code from Jean Meloche).\n\n    o\tFunction page() to view an R object in a pager.\n\n    o\tSupport for handling embedded '\\n's in text strings\n\thanded to low-level graphics functions has been added.\n\tSome changes to the PostScript graphics driver were\n\tneeded to support this, so there may some minor change\n\tin the appearance of plots produced in PostScript.\n\n    o\tThe LaTeX documentation is now split into 2 parts: the (currently\n\talmost non-existent) manual and a reference index.\n\tManual: new section on loading C++ code.\n\n    o\t[EXPERIMENTAL] Gnome support added. Use ./configure --with-gnome\n\tto try it, but don't expect too much yet.\n\n    o   HDF5 support improved. Still not perfect, though.\n\n    o\tThe X11 graphics driver can now use a variety of strategies\n\tfor handing color.  This means that it is now possible to\n\tuse black and white or grayscale graphics on color displays.\n\tThere are two strategies for handing color on pseudocolor\n\tdisplays.  The original &quot;allocate-colors-until-they-run-out&quot;\n\tstrategy has been supplemented by one which allocates a\n\tcolor cube at startup and approximates requested colors\n\tby those in the cube.  On truecolor displays, there is no\n\tlimit on the number of colors which can be displayed and\n\tyou get exactly the color you request.\t(Note that\n\tDirectcolor and staticcolor displays are not supported yet).\n\n    o\tThe &quot;persp&quot; function now allows shading of the rendered\n\tsurface using a simple lighting model.\n\n    o\tMany functions providing an interface to the operating system\n\thave been made &quot;platform independent&quot;.\tSee the manual entries\n\tfor &quot;file&quot;, &quot;list.files&quot; and &quot;file.show&quot; for details of the new\n\tinterface. The system.file() interface has been changed.\n\n    o\tThere is a new function &quot;eval.with.vis&quot; which behaves exactly\n\tlike &quot;eval&quot;, but which returns both the result of the evaluation\n\tan a logical value indicating whether the value is ``visible''.\n\tThis has been used to replace some ad-hoc tests for whether\n\tvalue should be printed or not in &quot;source&quot;.  As a consequence,\n\tthe &quot;example&quot; and &quot;demo&quot; functions no longer print invisible\n\tvalues when the example script is run.\n\n    o   Index files in data directories in packages should be `00Index'\n\tnot `index.doc'.\n\n    o   Function interaction() to compute factor interactions.\n\n    o   load() can load to specific environments.\n\n    o\tSockets interface: make/read/write/close.socket()\n\n    o\tFunction chull() for planar convex hulls\n\n    o\tpairs.formula() allows formula notations for scatter plot matrix.\n\n    o   new dataset co2.\n\n    o   documentation for datasets mtcars, plants, pressure, randu and sleep.\n\n    o   the sunspots dataset is now monthly rather than annual.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   strsplit(), scan() and friends use a much larger char buffer\n\t (still fixed size; this will change again)\n\n    o   ts() allows a data-frame argument `data'.\n\n    o   anova.lm handles singular models better, and deparses responses.\n\n    o   dump() now uses digits=12 rather than the current setting.\n\n    o   tabulate ignores entries beyond nbins rather than core dumps.\n\n    o\t?.C documents what C/Fortran types R objects correspond to\n\tin foreign function calls, which is not what everyone thought.\n\n    o\tchanged long to int in several .C calls to follow the above rules.\n\n    o\trbind(x1,x2) now does not lose dimnames when xi are \n\tcharacter or complex.\n\n    o\treadline() accidentally inherited menu()'s prompt.\n\n    o\t.C() and .Fortran() now correctly report that there might be\n\tNaN/Infs, not just NAs, unless NAOK=TRUE.\n\n    o\tResizing an inactive graphics window to an invalid size left\n\tthat window active and produced a spurious prompt and newline\n\tin the console window.\tThis no longer happens.\n\n    o\tpoly() rescales x to increase accuracy\n\n    o\tapply() preserves names in yet another case [-&gt; new example].\n\n    o\tphyper() now works for larger arguments than before.\n\n    o\tMissing values didn't work in log plot\n\n    o\touter() doesn't produce all-empty dimnames any more\n\n    o\tquantile.default() works when `probs' has zero length\n\n    o\texample() now works again in all cases [AnIndex spaces].\n\n    o\ttypos fixed in nlm() message, glm help\n\n    o\tpt() now works better for extreme `df' arguments and gives\n\tat least an approximate answer for ncp &gt; 37.6. __more to change__\n\n    o\tfixed some glitches with formatC() and its docs.\n\n    o\tseveral fixes in *.c code to make -Wall happy\n\n    o\tcurve() [and plot.function()] now use proper `x' values with log=&quot;x&quot;;\n\t`type = &quot;.&quot;' now works with curve() and plot.function()\n\n    o   zapped old windows files since they didn't build any more. \n\tThe sources for the later gnuwin32 version are expected to \n\tappear here for 0.64.1. The #ifdef Win32's here are for that\n\tversion.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

In particular, `make install', `make uninstall'\n\tand `make install-strip' now work.\n\tAlso, it is now possible to build R in a non-source directory.\n\n    o\twhich() preserves names and has a new `arr.ind' argument\n\tallowing for array indices.\n\n    o\tNew functions {d,p,q,r}signrank for the Wilcoxon signed rank\n\tdistribution, and {d,p,q,r}wilcox for the Wilcoxon (rank sum)\n\tdistribution.\n\n    o\tCommand line options GNUified a bit further.\n\tNew command line option `--verbose' for printing more\n\tinformation about progress.\n\tCommand line options `--vsize' and `--hsize' as replacements\n\tfor `-v' and `-n' which are now deprecated.\n\tAdded `--silent' as synonym for `--quiet'.\n\tShort-style option `-V' obsolete.\n\n    o\tAdded bug.report() to generate &amp; send bug reports from\n\twithin R.\n\n    o\tThe PostScript device driver now uses the ISO Latin1 font\n\tencoding.  This should allow Western Europeans to render\n\ttheir languages correctly.  It is likely that additional\n\tencodings will be added (e.g. Latin2) when we figure out\n\thow to set the correct font encoding in printers.\n\n    o\tThe mathematical annotation code has been reworked.  Italic\n\tcorrection works better.  Additional functionality will be\n\tadded.\n\n    o\t&quot;sample&quot; now has an optional &quot;prob&quot; argument which gives the\n\tprobabilities of sampling each element in the vector being\n\tsampled.  The present implementation is based on some code\n\tfrom E. S. Venkatraman &lt;<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">venkat at biosta.mskcc.org</A>&gt;.\n\n    o\tThe internal data structure used to represent lists has\n\tchanged from being based on dotted pairs to generic vectors.\n\tUsers should see no changes as a result (with the exception\n\tof some efficiency gains in list operations).\n\n    o\tSubscripting matches that of S more closely.  It is now\n\tpossible to use subscripting beyond that the end of vectors\n\tand lists.\n\n    o\tElement labelling in &quot;c&quot; and &quot;unlist&quot; should match that of\n\tof S.\n\n    o\tAdded split.screen etc functions for manipulating multiple\n\tscreens on a single device\n\n    o\tAfter help.start() the HTML help system is used for all help()\n\trequests. The name of the browser is now controlled by\n\toptions(&quot;browser&quot;).\n\n    o\tAdded kmeans to package mva (donated by B. Ripley)\n\n    o\tNew persp function added.  It is NOT compatible with S (yet)\n\tand is subject to internal and interface changes.\n\n    o\tgctorture() for torturing the garbage collector to reveal\n\tmemory protection bugs. (Call GC on every memory allocation). \n\n    o\tB. Ripley's aov code (and more) has been added. This includes: \n\n\t- aov() now handles models with Error terms, multiple\n\t  responses. \n\n\t- proj(), model.tables(), se.contrast(), replications(),\n\t  eff.aovlist() are implemented for aov fits, and where\n\t  appropriate for lm fits.\n\n\t- dummy.coef(), with methods for lm and aovlist fits.\n\n\t- add1(), drop1(), step() for stepwise fitting of statistical\n\t  models, with default, lm and glm methods.\n\n\t- summary() and deviance() -- mlm methods.\n\n\t- kappa()  for estimating condition numbers) \n\n\t- labels() to find a suitable set of labels from an object\n\n\t- C() for setting the contrasts of a factor\n\n\t- anova(), plot(), summary() and deviance() methods for mlm fits\n\n    o\teval() semantics changed when envir= is a list. A 3rd argument is \n\tnow allowed, specifying the enclosure (i.e. where R looks for\n\tvariables *not* found in envir=) it defaults to the calling \n\tenvironment (was .GlobalEnv). Note that when used inside a function,\n\tit is often desirable to set the enclosure to the parent \n\tenvironment instead. [ eval(e, data, sys.frame(sys.parent())) ] \n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o\tmin(NULL); max(double())  now give warnings.  range() gives NA.\n\n    o\tsubstring(&quot;&quot;, NULL) no longer segfaults.\n\n    o\tformatC(.) now takes default &quot;width = 1&quot; when both width and digits\n\tare unspecified.\n\n    o\tseveral fixes in internal axis and tickmarks setup for\n\t&quot;extreme&quot; ranges and values, especially for &quot;log&quot; scaling.\n\n    o\tseq(a,a, by=b) now works properly.\n\n    o\tprint.data.frame(.) now calls print.matrix instead of print(.)\n\twhich finally enables the 'right = TRUE' argument.\n\n    o\tR --help  gives more\n\n    o\tpostscript() now uses 'hyphen' instead of 'plusminus' for a minus.\n\n    o\tsource(..., echo=TRUE) now puts a `&quot;' if necessary after truncation.\n\n    o\tChanges to the PostScript device driver mean that the volume\n\tof output has been reduced to about a third of what it was.\n\n    o\tFixes and restructuring to name generation in connection with\n\tunlist() and c().\n\n    o\tMany bugs found and fixed in the memory allocation / garbage\n\tcollection area. In particular, the parser was sometimes\n\tUNPROTECT()ing the wrong pointers.\n\n    o\tlm(y[g==&quot;1&quot;]~x[g==&quot;1&quot;]) caused memory corruption\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

As usual, do not fetch it from there unless\nabsolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The\nfiles should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and\nthe rest of CRAN within days.\n\n[And, may I add, the NZ connection is slower than a sloth in a tarpit.\nI had turnaround times of up to at least 15s while packaging the\nrelease!]\n\nThis is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but with a few new\nfeatures too.\n\nMost likely, this will be the last of the 0.62 series, 0.63 is getting\npretty stable now.\n\nHere's the top of the CHANGES file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.3\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   preserve factor levels and contrast settings in model objects\n\n    o   factor[...,drop=T] reduces level set\n\n    o   added dblepr, intpr\n\n    o   do_modelmatrix(model.c): Set rownames from data argument.\n\n    o   New generic function preplot().\n\n    o\tA new R BATCH interface for non-interactive execution.\n\n    o   Added `offline' argument to help() for producing hardcopy via\n\tlatex and dvips.\n\n    o   glm.fit.null now calculates AIC and print.glm.null prints it\n\n    o   effects.lm implemented\n\n    o   new class &quot;mlm&quot; for multivariate &quot;lm&quot;, predict.mlm to go with it\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   biplot[.default]() was redundant in &quot;base&quot; package; now only in &quot;mva&quot;.\n\n    o\tunix(..) now helps the user to find  system(..) instead.\n\n    o   apropos(&quot;[&quot;) and methods(&quot;[&quot;) now both work (even though &quot;[&quot; is not\n\ta valid regular expression).\n\n    o   row.names&lt;-.default now exists. Converts object to data\n        frame and then adds row names\n\n    o\tcodes() now distinguishes between ordered and unordered factors\n\n    o\tcodes() had *opposite* semantics of Splus. Now it's the same.\n\n    o   replicating factors now yields factors (again)\n\n    o   print.summary.xxx  functions more consistent, using new function\n\tprint.coefmat().\n\n    o   Changed many `T' to `TRUE'  and  `F' to `FALSE' in the base package.\n\n    o   binary operation on 1x1 matrix lost dimension\n\n    o   fix anova.glm for null model\n\n    o   glm.fit.null: ensure df.residual == df.null for a null model\n\n    o   summary.glm: correlations in saturated cases\n\n    o   stat.anova: use match.arg and labeled switch statement\n\n    o   Major cleanup of glm iteration code\n\n    o   Correct reordering of glm coefficients if pivoting\n\n    o   Rownames on contrast matrices\n\n    o   factor() and [.factor preserves class &quot;ordered&quot;\n\n    o   Code rearrangement in predict.lm (avoid unnecessary computation)\n        + let rownames through on predictions\n\n    o   model.matrix.default: Initial code to define model frame\n        simplified considerably after defaulting data argument to\n        sys.frame(sys.parent()).  This also removes the problem where\n        data.frame mangles I(x^2) and similar names, so that the\n        &quot;reorder&quot; sanity check at the end fails.\n\n    o\tThe handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)\n\tshould now be correct.  Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be\n\tlinked against these libraries.\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

As usual, do not fetch it from there unless\nabsolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The\nfiles should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and\nthe rest of CRAN within days.\n\n[This time I seem to have managed to get the release out on the same\ndate for all core team members -- the Auckland time stamps say &quot;Jul 10\n23:59&quot;...]\n\nThis is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but we have also let some\nnew features slip in this time.\n\nHere's the top of the CHANGES file:\n\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.2\n\n(The new functions predict.glm, poly, aov, alias, biplot.default and\nbiplot.princop, update.default and rug all come from Brian D. Ripley,\nwho is also responsible for finding and/or fixing a lot of the bugs)\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   predict.glm() added.\n\n    o   text() is generic.\n\n    o   update.default() (replaces update.glm() and update.lm()).\n        (This will only work if you comment out update.lm and\n\tupdate.glm in the sources, or disable them with\n\tupdate.lm&lt;-function(object,...)NextMethod(), etc.)\n\n    o\tpredict.lm() changed towards S-plus compatibility. Intervals are\n\tstill available via interval= argument.\n\n    o\tzapsmall() function.\n\n    o\tpolygon() now handles NAs\n\n    o\toptions(show.signif.stars = TRUE).  If FALSE,\n\tsummary.lm and similar functions do *not* print significance stars\n\tanymore.\n\n    o\tpoly() for [g]lm modelling.\n\n    o\taov()\tfor Analysis Of Variance [anova].\n\n    o\talias() for displaying ``aliased'' factor levels in (&gt;=2)way anova.\n\n    o\tmva: Now has  biplot and biplot.princomp\n\n    o\trug() plot.\n\n    o\tnew  src/library/profile/Common.R   for\t OS-independent intialization.\n\n    o   new date stamp mechanism (ensures that prerelease versions carry\n        correct date)\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   abbreviate() now always retains the first letter. \n\n    o   attr() partial matches for attribute name.\n\n    o   axis() accepts graphical parameters.\n\n    o   binomial() accepts factor responses.\n\n    o   cbind() works with data frames. \n\n    o   contrasts() gives simpler labels (like S) for factors with\n        two levels.\n\n    o   contrasts&lt;-() now has a how.many= argument.\n\n    o   contour() and image() can accept a list to specify the matrix.\n\n    o   contr.poly() uses orthogonal polynomials (like S) not raw\n        polynomials.\n\n    o   data() could fail with a partial match to the dataset name.\n\n    o   density() works correctly if from= or to= are used.\n            n= can now take any value, not just a large power of 2.\n\n    o   expand.grid() now accepts more than two arguments, \n        or a list of factors.\n\n    o   factor() and ordered() handle their levels argument better.\n\n    o   family.glm() now returns the correct family (including link etc).\n\n    o   legend() now knows about lwd.\n\n    o   match.args() works correctly for default arguments.\n\n    o   model.frame.lm() did not invoke `lm'.\n\n    o   model.matrix() calls model.frame() if needed.\n\n    o   model.response() now returns names, so glm() gives names to\n        residuals, fitted values, etc.\n\n    o   quasi() works in glm() (was missing aic component).\n\n    o   seq() sometimes omitted the final value due to rounding error.\n\n    o   terms.formula() and update.formula() now resolve `.' in formulae\n        and tidy up `(a + b) - b' etc.\n    \n    o   ... is now passed down correctly to functions inside functions.\n\n    o   save.image didn't work (Martyn Plummer)\n\n    o   abs() instead of fabs() in seq.c crashed R on Digital Unix\n\n    o   model.matrix() gagged on variables with complicated names \n\n    o   saturated models acting up in glm\n\n    o   various improvement of build procedures\n\n    o   rbind(NULL, matrix) core dump\n\n    o\tdensity() default 'bw' now 0.9*(...) instead of 1.06*(...)\n\t\t\t\t[=Silverman's rule of thumb].\n\n    o\tdetach(2) now works.\n\n    o\tformat() doesn't drop names anymore.\n\n    o\tformat.pval() works with NAs.\n\n    o\tprint.[summary.][g]lm() functions print numbers better formatted.\n\n    o\tlegend() now also works properly in  log coordinates.\n\n    o\tbacksolve() now working;  bakslv.c not depending on\n\tFortran_underscores.\n\n    o\tTick marks acting up on log axes in postscript (fix from Martyn Plummer)\n\n    o\tThe Rd format has a new section \\details{} (needed for proper\n\tSd2Rd translation). \\R was not understood for nroff\n\tconversions, longer dashes (-- and --- in latex syntax) are\n\tnow converted properly.\n\n    o\tprompt.default() now carries &quot;\\details{}&quot;.\n\n    o\tR [ SHLIB | COMPILE ] were broken on some Solaris systems\n\tdue to use of bash syntax. R [ INSTALL | COMPILE | SHLIB ]\n\tnow use a MAKE environment variable if present.\n\tR INSTALL only rebuilds man pages if they are not already\n\tup to date.\n\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

(f2c is good enough)\n\nHere is the relevant part of the CHANGES file:\n\n\t\tCHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   Many more help(.) pages.\n\n    o   The top level Makefile now supports the usual\n\t   ./configure; make; make install\n\tprocedure (new make targets `all' and `install').\n\n    o   The HTML help pages can now be searched for keywords.\n\n    o\tConversion of functions to and from lists. formals&lt;- and body&lt;-.\n\tThe alist() function makes it easier to construct argument lists,\n\tetc. Added expression--&gt;list coercion.\n\n    o\tcomplex(.) now has optional 'argument' and 'modulus' arguments,\n\tallowing ``polar coordinate'' specifications.\n\n    o\tlayout() documented and improved: starts default device if needed, and\n\treturns number of figures.\n\n    o\tNew find() function [relying on apropos(..)].\n\n    o\tobjects(&lt;integer&gt;) now works, being equivalent to\n\tobjects(pos=&lt;int.&gt;).\n\n    o\tstorage.mode() and related functions now return\n\t&quot;double&quot; instead of &quot;real&quot;, for compatibility.\n\t&quot;real&quot; is still allowed as synomym for &quot;double&quot;.\n\n    o\tA tests/ directory has been added (in the source), and &quot;make tests&quot;\n\thas been modified to run more than all the examples from the base\n\tpackage.  The exact 'make tests' behavior is still bound to change.\n\n    o\tAn experimental directory etc/Rdoc has been added with a perl5\n\tmodule to parse R documentation files.\tSample perl programs\n\tto use this module are also included.\n\n    o\tAll internal mechanisms to support factors and data.frames\n\thave been removed.  These are now entirely supported by\n\tinterpreted code! `is.unordered' has been eliminated.\n\tThanks to John Chambers for allowing the distribution of his\n\tStatLib code.\n\n    o\t&quot;pmatch&quot; is now completely S compatible and is not just another\n\tname for &quot;charmatch&quot;.\n\n    o\tThere is now a function called &quot;.Alias&quot; which can be used to\n\tprovide multiple names for the same object.  Example:\n\t\tlm2 &lt;- .Alias(lm)\n\tThis is dangerous because it can be used to defeat the\n\tcall-by-value illusion.\n\n    o\tMany functions changed from &lt;primitive&gt; to .Internal(..).\n\tCurrently, new .Internal(.)s in ..library/base/R/New-Internal.R\n\tPrimitive functions are now printed as ``.Primitive(..)''.\n\n    o\t[dpqr]hyper(.) now also work with some 0 arguments.\n\n    o\tC-code: Many &quot;-Wall&quot; fixes (MM &amp; DB).\n\n    o\tmva's dist() now takes arguments diag and upper which control\n\thow the distance matrix is printed. plot.hclust() now takes a\n\tlabels argument.\n\n    o\tAttributes are now propagated correctly in binary operations.\n\tChanges from:\n\t  Steve Oncley and Gordon Maclean\n\t  National Center for Atmospheric Research\n\t  Boulder, Colorado USA\n\n    o\tconfigure now also checks for fort77.\n\n    o\tUsage of R INSTALL now is\n\t  R INSTALL [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n\n\tThe +/- options were replaced by GNU-style `--no-docs' and\n\t`--no-text', `--no-html', and `--no-latex'.\n\n    o\tUsage of R REMOVE now is\n\t  R REMOVE [options] [-l lib] pkg_1 ... pkg_n\n\n    o\tUsage of R COMPILE now is R COMPILE [options] srcfiles, where\n\tthrough options one can set e.g. CFLAGS or FFLAGS.\n\n    o\tUsage of R SHLIB now is R SHLIB [-o libname] files, where the\n\tfile names can be that of source or object files.\n\n    o   A new R CMD interface allows invokation of executables in\n\t$RHOME/{etc,cmd} without installing them or setting paths.\n\n    o\tData files are now also documented using the Rd format, all\n\tdata documentation in the base package has been converted\n\taccordingly. Rd files for data have a \\keyword{datasets} as\n\tidentifier.\n\n    o\tnew function mahalanobis() for Mahalanobis distance\n\n    o\tquantile.default() now handles Inf's correctly.\n\n    o\tNew command line options `--enable-blas' and `--enable-readline'\n\tto configure.\n\n    o\tpretty(x) is more reasonable when max(x)-min(x) &lt; 1e-10 max(|x|),\n\tand has a new argument &quot;shrink.sml&quot; for that case.\n\n    o\tformatC(.) supports a new &quot;fg&quot; format for flexible\n\tnon-exponential formatting.\n\n    o\tetc/build-htmlpkglist has been integrated into etc/build-help\n\t(option --htmllists)\n\n    o\tfamily\tgaussian(.) and inverse.gaussian(.) both accept several\n\tlink arguments [J.Lindsey].\n\n    o\tThe graphics function &quot;tck&quot; now produces effects just\n\tlike those in S (e.g. par(tck=1) now produces grid lines).\n\tSince using &quot;tck&quot; produces nasty results in some circumstances\n\tthere is also an alternative parameter &quot;tcl&quot; which defines\n\tthe tick length in terms of lines of text.  The default\n\tsetting is par(tcl=-0.5).\n\n    o\tmenu() now takes additional arguments `graphics' (currently\n\tunused) and `title'.\n\n    o\tNew function plot.formula().\n\tplot.factor() now produces boxplots when given 2 arguments.\n\n    o\tNew function write.table().\n\n    o\tsignif() now has a `digits' default of 6.\n\n    o\tOld-style long command line options (`-save' etc) changed to\n\tGNU-style (`--save' etc).\n\tDebugging options (`-ddd', `-gdb', `-xxgdb') unified into the\n\tnew `--debugger' (`-d').\n\tNew command line options `--version' (`-V') and `--help' (`-h')\n\twhich print useful information and exit.\n\n    o\tThe loading of profiles at startup now works as follows.\n\tUnless the new `--no-site-file' was given, a site profile is\n\tsought (as specified via the environment variable `RPROFILE',\n\tor if this is unset defaulting to `${RHOME}/etc/Rprofile'.\n\tThen, unless the new `--no-init-file' was given, the user\n\tprofiles (`.Rprofile' and `~/.Rprofile') are sought.\n\n    o\tNew functions subset() and transform() intended primarily to\n\tmake life with dataframes easier.\n\n    o\tdebian directory has been added so Debian GNU/Linux packages can be\n\tcreated from raw source.\n\n    o\tThe graphics system has been through a major overhaul.\n\tIt is now possible to have multiple active device drivers\n\tand to control them with full suite of dev.xxx() functions\n\tavailable in S.\t Display lists are now kept for interactive\n\tdevices.  When an on-screen graphics window is resized,\n\tthe content of that window is redrawn at the new size.\n\tAt present only X11 and PostScript graphics device drivers\n\tare available, but more are on the way.\n\n    o\tOn systems using IEEE arithmetic, the builtin Inf and NaN\n\tvalues are now recognised and used.  NA and NaN should\n\tpropagate correctly in computations, with NA dominating\n\tin computations involving both quantities.\n\tE.g. NA+NaN is NA.\n\n    o\tSome of the t, F, and chisq distribution/probability functions\n\tnow allow a noncentrality parameter `ncp'.\n\n    o\tFunctions ptukey() and qtukey() provide the distribution and\n\tquantile functions for the maximum of several studentized\n\tranges.\n\n    o\tsystem.file()  [now documented] returns all files matched by\n\twildcards.\n\n    o\tdata() now supports more file formats: .RData for binary\n\tfiles, .txt or .tab for data to be read by\n\t`read.table(file, header=TRUE)' and .csv for data to be read\n\tby `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;;&quot;)'\n\n    o\tRdconv: new tabular environment, new sections `\\format' and\n\t`\\source', new output format `-type Sd' for S documentation\n\n    o\t.First.lib() now implemented; called by library() after loading\n\ta package.\n\n    o\tprint.summary.[g]lm() now give `significance stars' and a symbolic\n\tcorrelation matrix.\n\n    o\tnew is.R() function.\n\n    o\tglm() now also returns an AIC value [from JL].\n\tprint..glm methods indicate the options()$contrasts in some cases.\n\tIn summary.glm(..., correlation=..), the default has been changed to\n\tcorr. = FALSE  which is consistent with\t summary.lm().\n\tpredict() now works again for glm objects.\n\n    o\tthe `flag' argument in formatC(.) can now have more than one\n\tcharacter.\n\n    o\tnlm() returns the number of iterations used [from J.Lindsey].\n\n    o\tcut, diff, hist, mean, quantile, seq, trunc()  are now all generic.\n\tcut() has an `include.lowest' argument as S.\n\n    o\tsave.image() as short-cut to save the current session in .RData.\n\n    o\tnew design of HTML help pages, including an index of all\n\tfunctions from all installed packages.\n\n    o\tnew editor function pico()\n\n    o\tmatrices and arrays can have zero extents\n\nBUG FIXES (many of which resulted from the added features...)\n\n    o\tatanh(.) now works\n\n    o   summary(glm) and summary(lm) now use compatible names.\n\n    o   [pq]tukey(.) now working.\n\n    o\ttitle() now handles main=, sub=, xlab=, ylab= with embedded\n\tnewlines correctly.  This is partly a change in title and\n\tpartly a change in the underlying graphics code.\n\n    o\tmin(.), max(.), sum(.)\tnow return integer for integer arguments.\n\n    o\twhich(.) now returns integer.\n\n    o\tRd files: leading whitespace of lines in user-defined sections\n\twas not correctly removed by Rdconv\n\n    o\tsign(.) works again.\n\n    o\t[.data.frame segfaulted if arg. wasn't a data frame\n\n    o\t&quot;R --no-readline&quot; now again gives proper prompts.\n\n    o\tdemos/zero.R  dyn.load(.) now should be working more easily.\n\n    o\tmode(.) now returns &quot;(&quot; for a &quot;parentheses 'call'&quot;.\n\n    o\tBug fix in mva dist.c for method binary (gave &quot;invalid\n\tdistance&quot;). plot.hclust failed for data without row names.\n\n    o\tR INSTALL should work (again) now when `pkg' is a relative file\n\tname.\n\n    o\t.not.yet.implemented() now takes an arbitrary number of args.\n\n    o\tPlotting of dendrograms is working again.\n\n    o\tdata.frame(.) now uses &quot;1:n&quot; as default row.names.\n\n    o\timage(.) and contour(.) now also work called as, e.g., ``image(z)''.\n\n    o\tthe first argument of axis(.) is now called `side' as in S.\n\n    o\tformat(NULL) now works.\n\n    o\tminor fix in symnum.\n\n    o\thist() now is more compatible to S, has a new `labels' argument,\n\tand should work ok for non-equidistant breaks.\n\n    o\tplot(-1) now labels properly.\n\n    o\tMany small code changes (eliminating extraneous variables, nested comm.)\n\tin C code in order to satisfy `gcc -Wall' [Doug Bates].\n\n    o\tmodel.extract() will now extract arbitrary model frame arguments.\n\n\n    o\tlist of currently loaded libraries (.Dyn.libs) not saved\n\tfrom session to session (really, this time)\n\n    o\trhyper works with vectorisation, degenerate cases.\n\n    o   printing of objects in lists now dispatches methods correctly\n\n\n-- \n   O__  ---- Peter Dalgaard             Blegdamsvej 3  \n  c/ /'_ --- Dept. of Biostatistics     2200 Cph.

Instructions for patching are in the VERSION file\nin same directory.\n\nThis release mainly fixes a number of trivial bugs (segfaults from\nstrange constructions and the like). One major change is that the\nchanges to factor coercion that was introduced previously was deemed\nto be buggy after all, so now as.numeric(factor(100,200)) == 1:2\nagain. A few features was also allowed to trickle down from the 0.62\nas-yet-unreleased version.\n\nJim Lindsey will probably be disappointed in finding that his\nfavourite model formula bugs are still there.

It should find its\nway to the main CRAN site in Vienna this evening and then to the rest\nof the CRAN sites. \n\nThere's also a patch file, R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz, which you can apply\nto an existing R-0.61 tree. Note that the proper patch procedure is as\nfollows -- assuming that your current working directory is the top\ndirectory of R-0.61 and the patch file is in the parent directory.\n\ngzip -dc ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1\n\nor on most installations, equivalently\n\nzcat ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1\n\nThe above requires that you have GNU &quot;patch&quot; installed. At least one\nsystem (Solaris) ships with a different &quot;patch&quot;, which exhibits some\nannoying bits of braindamage. If you want to use it, you're on your\nown...\n\nI removed changes to the file src/main/gram.c from the patchfile,\nbecause they amounted almost two thirds of the patchfile and the file\nis automatically generated from src/main/gram.y anyway. \n\nA few systems may not have a parser generator installed, and for the\nbenefit of those, I've also put up a R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.w.gram.c.gz\nfile. Note that you may need a &quot;touch src/main/gram.c&quot; to prevent\n&quot;make&quot; from trying to rebuild it.\n\nHere's the list of changes relative to 0.61 (from the CHANGES file):\n\n                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.1\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o   None (by definition, x.y.z releases are bugfix releases now)\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Return statements of the form return(x,y) will now return\n        a list with named components.\n\n    o   Parsing of nested &quot;if&quot; statments was broken.  This is fixed now.\n        (Reported by Paul Gilbert).\n\n    o   Wrong declaration of ConsoleBufCnt in src/main/scan.c caused crash\n        in Irix (George White &lt;<A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">gwhite at bodnext.bio.dfo.ca</A>&gt;)\n\n    o   if(nmatch = 0) bug in src/main/character.c fixed (Doug Bates)\n\n    o   R_alloc/S_alloc fixes.

Release of this version\nhas been delayed for a variety of reasons, but we hope that it will\nprovide a good deal more stability and functionality than previous\nversions.  However it should be regarded as of &quot;alpha&quot; quality for a\nshort shakedown period.\n\nWe would like user feedback to help us improve the quality of R.\nYou can do this by subscribing to the r-devel mailing list by sending\na message containing\n\t subscribe\n(in the &quot;body&quot;, not the subject!) to:\n        <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">r-devel-request at stat.math.ethz.ch</A>\n\nVersion 0.60 or R may be obtained from the following sites:\n\n\tTU Wein, Austria\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R\">ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R</A>\n\n\tIASC archive, Italy\n\t<A HREF=\"http://www.stat.unipg.it/pub/stat/statlib/R/CRAN/contents.html\">http://www.stat.unipg.it/pub/stat/statlib/R/CRAN/contents.html</A>\n\n\tUniversity of Aizu, Japan\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.u-aizu.ac.jp/pub/lang/R/CRAN/contents.html\">ftp://ftp.u-aizu.ac.jp/pub/lang/R/CRAN/contents.html</A>\n\n\tETH Zurich, Switzerland\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/R-CRAN/contents.html\">ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/R-CRAN/contents.html</A>\n\n\tStatlib, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\t<A HREF=\"http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/contents.html\">http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/contents.html</A>\n\n\tUniversity of Washington, USA\n\t<A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.biostat.washington.edu/mirrors/R/CRAN/contents.html\">ftp://ftp.biostat.washington.edu/mirrors/R/CRAN/contents.html</A>\n\n\tUniversity of Wisconsin, USA\n\t<A HREF=\"http://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/R/contents.html\">http://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/R/contents.html</A>\n\nThere are some large changes to R with this version (additional large\nchanges are planned for further versions).  In particular, the\ndocumentation format has changed and the general standard of\ndocumentation improved a good deal.  Perl version 5 is now required to\nprocess the documentation, but pre-formatted versions will be\navailable.\n\nR is now being developed by a larger group than its original authors.\nIn particular, this release represents the direct efforts of the\nfollowing group:\n\n\tPeter Dalgaard, Robert Gentleman, Kurt Hornik, Ross Ihaka,\n\tThomas Lumley, Friedrich Leisch, Martin Maechler, Paul Murrell,\n\tHeiner Schwarte and Luke Tierney.\n\nIn addition, hundreds of contributions, in the form of code, patches\nand bug reports, have been made by a much larger group of indiviuals. \n\nR is now a GNU project and will be making changes to meet GNU coding\nand installation standards.\n\nA detailed list of changes follows.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n    o\tThere has been a major change in directory structure masterminded\n\tby Kurt Hornik.\n\tlibrary(.) now attaches ``package''s which are better\n\tintegrated, see &quot;?library&quot;.  Packages may be available from\n\toutside the RHOME path via the .lib.loc variable.\n\n    o\tThe documentation format (of files in src/library/&lt;package&gt;/man/ )\n\thas changed to a more easily parsable LaTeX like format.\n\tThe doc files now all end in `.Rd'.\n\tetc/Rman2Rd  can be used to translate old-style documentation to\n\tthe new one.\n\tThe translation to *roff, LaTeX and HTML is now done using\n\tetc/Rdconv, written in Perl by Fritz Leisch.\n\n\tThe HTML online help produced has now links which work.\n\tThe manual (in doc/manual/) now includes a section on the\n\tdocumentation format and on mathematical text in graphs.\n\n\tetc/ further contains `Sd2Rd' for (partial) translation of S `.d'\n\tdocumentation to Rd, and\n\t`Rd2txt' and `Rd2dvi' for easy previewing of single Rd files.\n\n    o\tThe use of &quot;names&quot; on one dimensional arrays will now produce\n\tsensible results.  This means that for most purposes,\n\tone dimensional arrays can be treated like vectors.\n\n    o\tWe have a applied a patch from <A HREF=\"https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce\">mward at wolf.hip.berkeley.edu</A>\n\twhich should substantially improve the speed of (vector)\n\tarithmetic.\n\n    o\tThe modeling formula handler has been expanded so that it\n\taccepts y ~ 0 + x as a &quot;through the origin&quot; specification.\n\tmodels with no parameters are now acceptable.\n\n    o\t&quot;cov&quot;, &quot;cor&quot; and &quot;var&quot; now produce a matrix result if either\n\tof their x or y arguments is a matrix.\tDimnames are propagated\n\tin a sensible fashion.\n\n    o   New chisq.test(.) and prop.test() from Kurt Hornik.\n\n    o   New read.fwf(.) for reading fixed width format (KH).\n\n    o   New str(.) [alternative to summary(.) for programmers] (MM).\n\n    o   New example data sets &quot;esoph&quot;, &quot;infert&quot; and &quot;anscombe&quot; (TL),\n\t&quot;iris3&quot; (KH) and &quot;stackloss&quot; (MM).\n\n    o   source(.) has several new arguments, notably ``echo = FALSE''.\n\tThis is applied in the new function  demo(.) which runs all the\n\tcode in demos/ (but dynload).\n\n    o   strheight(.) is new, accompanying strwidth(.).\n\tBoth now work for mathematical expressions (Paul Murrell).\n\n    o   The LaTeX version of the manual (-&gt; doc/manual/) now has an index.\n\n    o   EVERY *.Rd file in src/library/base/man/ has now at least one \\keyword\n\n    o\tNew package (`library(.)') &quot;stepfun&quot; for step functions, incl.\n\tempirical distributions.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n    o   Regular expression matching is now done with system versions\n\tof the regexp library.  This should fix compilation problems\n\ton some platforms.\n\n    o\t&quot;approx&quot; and &quot;approxfun&quot;, have had some minor adjustments.\n\twhich fix the interpretation of the rule= argument.  The\n\tcode for piecewise constant case is now internal C code\n\tthat than interpreted.\tThis should boost performance in\n\tthis case.\n\n    o\tThere has been a minor fixup of &quot;model.frame&quot; to ensure that\n\tsubsets, weights, etc are handled properly.\n\n    o\tModel fitting of the form\n\n\t\t lm(y~., data=df)\n\t\tglm(y~., data=df)\n\n\twill now work.\tThe RHS of the model will consist of an\n\tadditive model containing all (non-respose) variabels in the\n\tgiven data frame.\n\n    o\tThe following type of assignment to data frame subsets\n\n\t\tz &lt;- data.frame(x=rnorm(10),y=rnorm(10),z=rnorm(10))\n\t\tz[,1:2] &lt;- matrix(1:20,nc=2)\n\n\twas producing incorrect results.  The solution was to wrap\n\tan implicit &quot;as.data.frame&quot; around the RHS.\n\n    o\t&quot;[.data.frame&quot; no longer has a default drop=TRUE argument.\n\tThis means that subsetting a data frame with &quot;[&quot; will always\n\tyield a data frame.\n\n    o\tThere was a swap of coordinates internally in &quot;mtext&quot; which\n\tmeant that labels were coming out in the wrong place.  Fixed.\n\n    o\tSyntax errors in parse(text=&quot;...&quot;) would cause R to terminate\n\twith a segmentation violation.\tThis no longer happens, although\n\tthe result is still not perfect (the parse() returns).\n\tThis will be fixed by a future parse rewrite.\n\n    o   rainbow, topo.colors, etc., now also work with n in {1,2};\n\tdon't return duplicate neighbor colors anymore.\n\n    o   legend has new `text.width' argument and now also works with\n\tmathematical expressions as text.\n\n    o   hist() now works better, has a `plot = TRUE' argument, and returns\n\tsomething useful.\n\n    o   barplot() improved for `names', now returns vector of midpoints.\n\n    o   lm(), lm.fit, lm.wfit (was `lm.w.fit'):  Made more compatible.\n\tDealing with (close to) collinear situations is still not flexible\n\tenough.\n\n    o   internal postcript() improved (missing lines in boxplot(.)).\n\n    o   Improvement to many (even most ?) documentation (.Rd) files.\n\n    o   Numerous other fixes of minor things ...\n\n\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-\nr-announce mailing list -- Read <A HREF=\"http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html\">http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html</A>\nSend &quot;info&quot;, &quot;help&quot;, or &quot;[un]subscribe&quot;\n(in the &quot;body&quot;, not the subject !)

Note that New Zealand\nis not close to anywhere other than itself :-).\n\nThis version adds considerable functionality and (we hope) stability\nto R.  Most notably, the object system is now very close to that\nof S and we now have a fairly full implementation of complex\narithmetic.\n\nThe jump in version number (from 0.16) relects the fact that we\nfeel that this version of R represents quite a jump toward what we\nhope will be in our eventual 1.0 release.  However the version is\nnumbered 0.49 rather than the 0.50 we touted because it falls a\nlittle short of what we really want for 0.50.\n\nImmediate development of R will focus on creating a coherent way\nof loading and unloading &quot;libraries&quot; and creating a good framework\nfor documentation (can you say &quot;SGML&quot; - I knew you could).\n\nA (partial) list of changes from 0.16.1 follows.  A list of known\nproblems is kept in the file &quot;TASKS&quot; in the distribution and a list\nof problems we think are solved is in &quot;TASKS.OLD&quot;\n\n\tR + R\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t\t  CHANGES IN VERSION R VERSION 0.49 ALPHA\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n o  The ``object'' system has been changed substantially.  The\n    behavior of both &quot;UseMethod&quot; and &quot;NextMethod&quot; should match that\n    in S.  Group methods for &quot;Math&quot;, &quot;Ops&quot; and &quot;Summary&quot; are\n    available.\n\n o  Complex arithmetic is now implemented.  Many mathematical\n    functions are now defined for complex arguments (e.g. sqrt,\n    exp, log, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan).  There is no\n    complex gamma function or log gamma function yet.  The summary\n    functions &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;prod&quot;, &quot;cumsum&quot; and &quot;cumprod&quot; work\n    correctly when (some of) their arguments are complex.  Other\n    functions such as &quot;solve&quot; are not &quot;complex aware&quot; yet, but do\n    print warning messages about coercion of complex values\n    to real by the dropping of imaginary parts.\n    S and R do not return identical results in all cases:\n\tS&gt; atan(tan(1i))\n\t[1] 0-1i\n\tR&gt; atan(tan(1i))\n\t[1] 0+1i\n    [ Is this just a difference on the branch cut boundary? ]\n\n o  The full set of S graphics symbols is now available with pch=0:18.\n    In addition, there is a special set of R plotting symbols which\n    can be obtained with pch=29:25.\n\tpch=19  solid circle\n\tpch=20\tbullet\n\tpch=21\tcircle\n\tpch=22\tsquare\n\tpch=23\tdiamond\n\tpch=24\ttriangle point-up\n\tpch=25\ttriangle point down\n    The symbols 21:25 can be colored and filled with different colors.\n    For example, the expression\n\tpoints(x, y, pch=21, col=&quot;red&quot;, bg=&quot;yellow&quot;)\n    will plot the points using a symbol consisting of a red circle with\n    a yellow interior.\n\n o  There is a new &quot;family&quot; argument to the postscript graphics driver\n    which can be set to any of &quot;AvantGarde&quot;, &quot;Bookman&quot;, &quot;Courier&quot;,\n    &quot;Helvetica&quot;, &quot;Helvetica-Narrow&quot;, &quot;NewCenturySchoolbook&quot;, &quot;Palatino&quot;\n    or &quot;Times&quot;.  In addition, setting font=5 will cause the &quot;Symbol&quot;\n    family to be used.  This is still experimental and it is hard to\n    see it being useful without some sort of math capability.\n    [ Such a facility is &quot;on the drawing board&quot;. ]\n\n o  The graphics parameter &quot;las&quot; is now implemented and can be used\n    to rotate axis labels.  E.g.  plot(1:10, las=1) .\n\n o  The hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions cosh, sinh, tanh,\n    acosh, asinh and atanh are now implemented for both real and complex\n    arguments.  (Q: are the underlying functions available on all\n    platforms, or do we need compatibility fixes?)\n\n o  &quot;log&quot; has changed so that it will accept an optional &quot;base&quot; argument.\n    &quot;log2&quot; and &quot;log10&quot; are implemented this way.\n\n o  &quot;atan&quot; can now either be invoked as atan(x) or atan(x,y).\n\n o  The behavior of &quot;fft&quot; has been modified to match that of S\n    (i.e.  it returns a complex value.  There is also a function\n    &quot;mvfft&quot; which performs a &quot;vector transform&quot; when passed a matrix\n    (i.e.  it applies the fft to each column, rather than doing a\n    2d spatial transform).\n\n o  A new functon &quot;polyroot&quot; can be used to find the roots of\n    polynomials with (real or) complex coefficients.\n\n o  Vectors and lists are now &quot;stretchy&quot;.  This means that the\n    following is legal\n\tx &lt;- 1:10\n\tx[20] &lt;- 12\n    [ Note that there is a bug in S.  When you try this kind of\n    extension - the &quot;dim&quot; and &quot;dimname&quot; attributes are not dropped,\n    leading to &quot;invisible&quot; elements in the result. ]\n\n o  Symbolic differention is now available using the functions &quot;D&quot;\n    and &quot;deriv&quot;.  The results are slightly difference in appearance\n    from those of S (which tends to put in a few too many parentheses),\n    but should provide identical semantics.  To see the nature of the\n    difference, try the expression\n\tD(expression(tan(x)/x^2),&quot;x&quot;)\n    in both systems.\n    These functions are implemented as internal code in R (what's the\n    point in having a nice little underlying lisp if you don't use it\n    for obvious list processing applications?).\n\n o  A new function &quot;grep&quot; has been implemented.  It performs regular\n    expression matching based on POSIX 1003.3.  The function uses the\n    &quot;regex&quot; library written by Henry Spencer (the same one that Perl\n    uses).  Grep is now used to provide a pattern matching facility\n    in &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;ls&quot;.  In addition, there are functions &quot;sub&quot;\n    and &quot;gsub&quot; which operate the same way as those in &quot;nawk&quot;.  Note\n    that &quot;\\&quot; must be escaped to get it into a string, so if you want\n    a literal &quot;\\&quot; you must type &quot;\\\\\\\\&quot; :-(.\n\n o  A new &quot;methods&quot; function written by Martin Maechler replaces the\n    older less sophisticated one.  This has also been converted to use\n    the new &quot;grep&quot; function.\n\n o  A new version of model.frame from Thomas Lumley is included.\n\n o  Factors and ordered factors are now &quot;objects&quot; with class attributes\n    which match those in S.  This change is primarily so that applications\n    written for S will work in R.  The underlying implementation for\n    factors and ordered factors still uses special underlying types.\n\n o  R will now do conditioning plots as described in the S &quot;Models&quot; book.\n    Some thought is going into &quot;doing trellis&quot;.\n\n o  Thomas Lumley's &quot;require&quot; and &quot;provide&quot; functions for library\n    organization added.\n\n o  There is a new graphical parameter &quot;gamma&quot; which is designed to\n    let users apply a ``gamma'' correction for their graphics\n    displays.  Most monitors produce a color intensity which is\n    related to voltage by the equation\n\t\t\tintensity = voltage ^ gamma\n    with gamma about 2.5 for most PC monitors.  A typical symptom\n    of this non-linearity is that a colorwheel produced by\n\t\t\tpiechart(rep(1,48), col=48)\n    shows a marked over representation of the red, green and blue\n    and blue primaries.  If this is the case try\n\t\t\tpar(gamma=1/2.5)\n    and redraw the color wheel.  Vary gamma till you have a &quot;nice&quot;\n    spectrum.  This is experimental and feedback would be welcome.\n    (If this is useful we will do the same for postscript).\n\n\nBUG FIXES &amp; ENHANCEMENTS\n\n o  The internals of the postscript device drivers have been rewritten\n    in preparation for &quot;doing equations&quot;.  The Adobe font metrics\n    are no longer processed during the build process.  The original\n    files are now processed directly by the driver.  The postscript\n    emitted by the drivers should conform to the Adobe 3.0 standard.\n\n o  Typos and logic errors in &quot;crossprod&quot; pointed out by Arne Kovac\n    have been fixed.\n\n o  &quot;round&quot; now works using IEEE rounding on platforms which support it.\n    E.g.\n\t&gt; round(.5 + -3:7)\n\t [1] -2 -2  0  0  2  2  4  4  6  6  8\n\n o  A change to the PostScript graphics device driver change should\n    stop plots from rotating unexpectedly when viewed with ghostview\n    and other postscript viewers.\n\n o  Patches from Kurt Hornik for &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;help&quot; have been applied.\n\n o  &quot;names&quot; applied to 1-d arrays now does the &quot;right thing&quot; i.e. it\n    returns the first component of the &quot;dimnames&quot; attribute rather than\n    NULL.  Subsetting a 1-d array as a vector will produce a &quot;names&quot;\n    attribute on the result.\n    \n o  &quot;atan&quot; will now accept either 1 or 2 arguments (&quot;atan2&quot; still exists).\n\n o  &quot;nchar&quot; and &quot;format&quot; preserve &quot;dim&quot; and &quot;dimname&quot; attributes where\n    possible.\n\n o  There were problems with arguments in &quot;switch&quot;.  These have been\n    fixed.  There appears to be a bug in S with the expression\n\t\tz &lt;- switch(1, a=, b=10, 20)\n\t\tmode(z)\n    They appear to return a &quot;missing argument&quot;.  We die with an error\n    message.  What is the right thing to do here?\n\n o  Problems deparsing arguments of the form &quot;a&quot;= and a=, have been fixed.\n\n o  The default graphics line width is now 1 rather than 0.\n\n o  &quot;as.is&quot; problem in &quot;read.table&quot; pointed out by Peter Dalgaard fixed.\n\n o  paste(list(character(0),&quot;&quot;), 1:2) no longer causes a segfault.\n    &quot;as.character&quot; applied to a list now returns the vector obtained\n    by deparsing each element of the list.\n\n o  &quot;attach&quot; now attaches objects at pos=2 when directed.\n\n o  Memory usage was measured in 1000 byte chunks with the -v flag.\n    This has been changed to 1024 byte chunks.\n\n o  Dependency on the &quot;OSF sprintf bug&quot; has been removed.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nr-announce mailing list -- Read <A HREF=\"http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html\">http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~hornik/R/R-FAQ.html</A>\nSend &quot;info&quot;, &quot;help&quot;, or &quot;[un]subscribe&quot;\n(in the &quot;body&quot;, not the subject !)
